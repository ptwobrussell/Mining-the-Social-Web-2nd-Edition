      "\n",
      "Facebook implements OAuth 2.0 as its standard authentication mechanism, and \"Example 5\" demonstrates how to use it to get an access token for making API requests once you've created an app and gotten a \"client id\" value that is used in the so-called \"OAuth dance.\" Note that you will need an ordinary Facebook account in order to login, create an app, and get these credentials. You can create an app through the \"Developer\" section of your account settings as shown below or by navigating directly to https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer. During development, however, you may sometimes find it more convenient to use the access token that's available to you through the Graph API Explorer tool at https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer.\n",
