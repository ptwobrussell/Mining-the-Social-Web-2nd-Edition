If you are already comfortable using a secure shell, you'll simply type <code>vagrant ssh</code> from the _vagrant_ folder where your _Vagrantfile_ is located, and you'll get automatically logged in if you have an SSH client already installed. \n",

In any event, if you've used an SSH client before, you'll have no troubles using <code>vagrant ssh</code> to perform a remote login.

For example, many of the scripts in IPython Notebooks may write out data files and you can easily access those data files on your host environment (should you desire to do so) without needing to connect into the virtual machine with an SSH session.

Most of the examples in this book do not entail consuming very large amounts of memory (the only notable exception could be Example 7-12 that builds a fairly large in-memory graph), but it's worth noting that most Vagrant boxes, including the default configuration for this book's virtual machine, have fairly low amounts of memory allocated to them by default. \n",

Consequently, if any of your IPython Notebooks ever consume close to 334MB of memory, you'll reach the limit that's allocated to the guest virtual machine and the kernel will kill the offending Python process. Unfortunately, IPython Notebook isn't able to provide a clear indication of what's gone wrong in this case, so your only clue as to what may have happened is that you'll no longer see a \"Kernel Busy\" message in the upper-right corner of the screen, and your variables in the notebook become undefined because the IPython Notebook kernel that's servicing the notebook has effectively restarted.\n",
