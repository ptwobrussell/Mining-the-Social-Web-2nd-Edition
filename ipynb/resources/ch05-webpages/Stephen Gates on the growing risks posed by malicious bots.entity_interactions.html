    <body>The O’Reilly Podcast: Protecting your <strong>organization</strong> against current and future <strong>threats.In</strong> this <strong>episode</strong> of the O’Reilly <strong>podcast</strong>, I spoke with <strong>Stephen Gates</strong> of Oracle Dyn. <strong>Gates</strong> joined the <strong>Oracle Dyn Global Business Unit</strong> from <strong>Zenedge</strong>, the web <strong>application security company</strong> recently acquired by Oracle. <strong>Gates</strong> and I discussed how growing malicious <strong>bot activity</strong> impacts organizations. Here are some <strong>highlights</strong>:
The <strong>rise</strong> of malicious <strong><strong>bots</strong></strong>

One of the <strong>factors</strong> driving the current <strong>proliferation</strong> of malicious <strong><strong>bots</strong></strong> is the <strong>Mirai</strong> malware. It works by using a <strong>list</strong> of <strong>default</strong> <strong>usernames</strong> and <strong>passwords</strong> (from previous <strong>data breaches</strong>) to take <strong>control</strong> of <strong>IoT</strong> devices. One <strong>key differentiator</strong> with <strong>Mirai</strong> is that it’s <strong>self-propagating—each</strong> infected <strong>device</strong> has the <strong>ability</strong> to scan the <strong>internet</strong> to find similar <strong>device</strong>s and subsequently infect them. This has also spurred other self-propagating, copycat malware. Another key <strong>factor</strong> driving malicious <strong>bot growth</strong> is the <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>malware</strong> that focuses on exploiting <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> (<strong>versus</strong> relying on <strong>usernames</strong> and passwords). The <strong>malware</strong> automates the <strong>process</strong> of scanning and infecting <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>devices</strong> for known vulnerabilities. Then, they're exploiting those known <strong>software</strong> <strong>vulnerabilities</strong>, which are quite common in <strong>IoT</strong> devices. The <strong>volume</strong> of <strong>attack traffic</strong> these <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> can generate is a huge <strong>differentiator</strong> because many of these <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> have <strong><strong>access</strong></strong> to pretty sizeable <strong>CPUs</strong>, and they've got <strong><strong>access</strong></strong> to a <strong>lot</strong> of bandwidth. As a <strong>result</strong>, we're seeing <strong>DDoS</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> being launched by these <strong>botnets</strong> in <strong>excess</strong> of 1.5 <strong>terabits</strong> per second. That's enough traffic to take a small country offline. Mitigating malicious <strong>bot</strong> <strong>threats</strong>

To manage the <strong>risks</strong> malicious <strong>bot</strong>s pose, <strong>organizations</strong> need to be aware that, realistically, <strong>bot</strong>s represent a significant <strong>portion</strong> of <strong>site</strong> and application traffic. They must understand the <strong>threats</strong> against their specific <strong>business</strong> <strong>models</strong> and recognize the <strong>need</strong> to build <strong>systems</strong> that can differentiate between good <strong><strong>bot traffic</strong></strong>, bad <strong><strong>bot traffic</strong></strong>, and human activity. <strong>Sites</strong> and <strong>applications</strong> must allow good <strong>bots</strong> to continue performing critical <strong>activities</strong> (<strong>scrape</strong> <strong>data</strong> for <strong>Google</strong> <strong>search</strong> <strong>queries</strong>, for <strong>example</strong>), but also mitigate malicious bot activity. <strong>Done</strong> poorly, you could reduce the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of your <strong>SEO</strong>, or worse yet, <strong>block</strong> paying <strong>customers</strong> from your <strong>sites</strong> or applications. An effective <strong>DDoS</strong> <strong>incident response plan</strong> includes <strong>detection</strong> and <strong>mitigation</strong> of these bot-driven attacks. <strong>Defenses</strong> should be layered, including cloud-based <strong>defenses</strong> for volumetric <strong>attacks</strong>, and most likely web <strong>application</strong> <strong>firewalls</strong> for the more measured <strong>attacks</strong>. Without having a <strong>DDoS</strong> <strong>response plan</strong> in <strong>place</strong>, you’re a sitting <strong>duck</strong> and effectively just waiting for one of these <strong>attacks</strong> to take your organization offline. Preparing for the malicious <strong>bot</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> of the <strong>future</strong>
The malicious <strong>bot</strong> threat landscape will continue to evolve rapidly. To prepare, <strong>organizations</strong> must embrace advanced <strong>data capabilities</strong>, such as <strong>AI</strong> and supervised <strong>machine learning</strong>, to detect and defeat sophisticated malicious <strong>bot</strong> attacks. Additionally, <strong>businesses</strong> need to focus on hiring <strong>security intelligence</strong> analysts. Embracing <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> is only helpful if we have the <strong>capabilities</strong> to analyze the output. Accordingly, <strong>security analyst</strong> <strong>skills</strong> will be in very high demand.
