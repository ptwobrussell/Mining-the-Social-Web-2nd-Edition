Challenges and <strong>Characteristics</strong> of <strong>Intelligent Autonomy</strong> for <strong><strong>Internet</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>Battle Things</strong></strong> in <strong>Highly Adversarial Environments</strong> -- <strong>Numerous</strong> artificially intelligent, networked <strong>things</strong> will populate the <strong>battlefield</strong> of the <strong>future</strong>, operating in close <strong>collaboration</strong> with human <strong>warfighters</strong>, and fighting as <strong>teams</strong> in highly adversarial environments. This <strong>paper</strong> explores the <strong>characteristics</strong>, <strong>capabilities</strong>, and <strong>intelligence</strong> required of such a <strong>network</strong> of intelligent <strong>things</strong> and <strong>humansâ€”Internet</strong> of <strong>Battle Things</strong> (IOBT). It will experience unique <strong>challenges</strong> that are not yet well addressed by the current <strong>generation</strong> of <strong>AI</strong> and machine learning.

<strong>T-Fuzz</strong>: <strong>Fuzzing</strong> by <strong>Program Transformation</strong> -- clever! To improve <strong>coverage</strong>, existing <strong>approaches</strong> rely on <strong>imprecise</strong> <strong>heuristics</strong> or complex <strong>input mutation</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> (<strong>e.g.</strong>, symbolic <strong>execution</strong> or <strong>taint analysis</strong>) to bypass <strong>sanity</strong> checks. Our novel <strong>method</strong> <strong>tackles</strong> <strong>coverage</strong> from a different <strong>angle</strong>: by removing <strong>sanity</strong> <strong>checks</strong> in the target program. <strong>T-Fuzz</strong> leverages a coverage-guided <strong>fuzzer</strong> to generate inputs. Whenever the <strong>fuzzer</strong> can no longer trigger new <strong>code</strong> <strong>paths</strong>, a <strong>lightweight</strong>, dynamic tracing-based <strong>technique</strong> detects the <strong>input</strong> <strong>checks</strong> that the <strong>fuzzer</strong>-generated <strong>input</strong>s fail. These checks are then removed from the target program. Fuzzing then continues on the transformed <strong>program</strong>, allowing the <strong>code</strong> protected by the removed <strong>checks</strong> to be triggered and potential bugs discovered. <strong>Data</strong> <strong>Sheets</strong> for <strong>Data</strong> Sets -- Currently there is no standard <strong>way</strong> to identify how a <strong>data set</strong> was created, and what <strong>characteristics</strong>, <strong>motivations</strong>, and potential skews it represents. To begin to address this <strong>issue</strong>, we propose the <strong>concept</strong> of a <strong>data sheet</strong> for <strong><strong>data sets</strong></strong>, a short <strong>document</strong> to accompany public <strong><strong>data sets</strong></strong>, commercial <strong>APIs</strong>, and pretrained models. Porting <strong>Prince</strong> of <strong>Persia</strong> to the <strong>BBC Master</strong> -- the <strong>author</strong> of the original 1980s <strong>game</strong>, <strong>Jordan Mechner</strong>, found and posted the <strong>source code</strong> to the <strong>Apple II</strong> version. These fine folks ported it to a different 1980s computer. I love the <strong>creativity</strong> of <strong>people</strong> who hack on small retro systems. I find big <strong>web stuff</strong> lacks that these <strong>days</strong>: it's all up-to-your-elbows in frameworks. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 3 April 2018.</body>
