    <body>A few <strong>ways</strong> to think differently and integrate <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> into your <strong>company</strong>'s altruistic <strong>pursuits.What</strong> do artificial <strong>intelligence</strong> (<strong><strong>AI</strong></strong>), <strong>invention</strong>, and social good have in common? While on the <strong>surface</strong> they serve very different <strong>purposes</strong>, at their <strong>core</strong>, they all require you to do one <strong>thing</strong> in order to be successful at them: think differently. Take the <strong>act</strong> of inventing—in <strong>order</strong> to develop a great <strong>patent</strong>, <strong>trade secret</strong>, or other intellectual <strong>property</strong>, you need to think outside of the box. Similarly, at the <strong>heart</strong> of <strong>AI</strong> is the <strong>act</strong> of unlocking new <strong>capabilities</strong>, whether that<strong>’</strong>s making virtual personal <strong>assistants</strong> like <strong>Alexa</strong> more useful, or creating a <strong>chatbot</strong> that provides a personalized <strong>experience</strong> to customers. And because of the constantly changing economic and social <strong>landscapes</strong>, coming up with impactful social good <strong>initiatives</strong> requires you to constantly <strong>approach</strong> <strong>things</strong> through a new lens. Individually, these <strong>fields</strong> have seen notable <strong>advancements</strong> over the past <strong>year</strong>, including new <strong>technologies</strong> that are bringing <strong>improvements</strong> to <strong>AI</strong> and large companies that are prioritizing giving back. But even more <strong>exciting</strong> is that we’re seeing more and more <strong>business</strong> <strong>leaders</strong> and <strong>nonprofits</strong> combining <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>innovation</strong>, and social good to reach <strong>communities</strong> in innovative <strong>ways</strong>, at a scale we’ve never before seen. There<strong>’</strong>s no better <strong>time</strong> than now to explore how your <strong>organization</strong> approaches your social good efforts. Here are a few <strong>ways</strong> you can think differently and integrate <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong>AI</strong> into your <strong>company</strong>’s altruistic pursuits. <strong>Approach</strong> social good through the <strong>mind</strong> of an <strong>inventor</strong>
As a master <strong>inventor</strong> at <strong>IBM</strong>, I’m <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>team</strong> responsible for helping the <strong>company</strong> become the leading <strong>recipient</strong> of <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>patents</strong> for the last quarter century. While developing <strong>patents</strong> and intellectual <strong>properties</strong> might not be what you’re setting out to do as <strong>part</strong> of your humanitarian <strong>efforts</strong>, the <strong>way</strong> we approach our <strong>jobs</strong> as <strong>inventors</strong> is <strong>something</strong> that can be applied across all aspects of giving back. Consider the <strong>United Nations</strong>’ 17 <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong>, which aim to eradicate <strong>things</strong> like <strong>poverty</strong>, <strong>hunger</strong>, disease, and more. These are game-changing initiatives that definitely require new ideas. What’s more, the <strong>United Nations</strong> estimates that we’re $5 trillion <strong>short</strong> on <strong>resources</strong> needed to accomplish these goals. How do we bridge this gap? Well, we need to start thinking differently. Foundationally, coming up with a great <strong>invention</strong> is identifying a <strong>problem</strong> that needs to be solved and coming up with an out-of-the-box <strong>idea</strong> that’s <strong>smart</strong>, has the biggest <strong>impact</strong>, and the lowest risk. To do <strong>t</strong>his, we look around us <strong>t</strong>o see which relevan<strong>t</strong> <s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong>echnologies</s<strong>t</strong>rong> we can use <strong>t</strong>ha<strong>t</strong> are already a<strong>t</strong> our <s<strong>t</strong>rong>disposal</s<strong>t</strong>rong> so we don’<strong>t</strong> have <strong>t</strong>o comple<strong>t</strong>ely reinven<strong>t</strong> <strong>t</strong>he <strong>wheel</strong> if we don’<strong>t</strong> have <strong>t</strong>o. We also identify which <strong>parts</strong> of the <strong>solution</strong> need a completely new <strong>idea</strong> to be created from scratch. Additionally, we look at the <strong>issue</strong> we’re trying to solve and the current <strong>landscape</strong> as a whole so we can predict any <strong>issue</strong>s or future <strong>problems</strong> that may arise, and we try to address them ahead of <strong>time</strong> in our invention. The same <strong>approach</strong> should be applied to social good—identify the <strong>problem</strong> you want to solve, the <strong>tools</strong> that already exist that can help you solve this <strong>dilemma</strong>, and the <strong>resources</strong> that need to be created or brought in from outside <strong>properties</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to execute your plan. At the <strong>heart</strong> of social good, similar to most <strong>inventions</strong>, are the people you’re trying to help. You need to make sure you’re maximizing the <strong>reach</strong> of your <strong>project</strong> while also minimizing any <strong>risks</strong> that may unintentionally create additional <strong>problems</strong> for the people you’re trying to help. To do this, you need to be creative in your approach. As an <strong>example</strong>, this is exactly the <strong>approach</strong> <strong>InvestEd</strong> is taking (full <strong>disclosure</strong>: I am an <strong>advisor</strong> for <strong>InvestEd</strong>). They started off by realizing they could commercialize and create social good at the same <strong>time</strong> by enabling financial <strong>education</strong> and <strong>facilitating</strong> <strong>microloans</strong> for small <strong>businesses</strong> in emerging markets. Helping these small <strong>businesses</strong> grow added more <strong>value</strong> to the small, local communities. And to make their <strong>product</strong> even better, <strong>InvestEd</strong> is adding <strong>AI</strong> <strong>capabilities</strong> to widen their <strong>offerings</strong> and provide a more innovative user experience. <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong>: Unlocking new <strong>capabilities</strong>
To grab the <strong>value</strong> and create disruptive <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> <strong>technology</strong> for social good <strong>ideas</strong>, we have to think beyond the typical <strong>automation</strong> <strong>activities</strong> of a machine. Take Guiding <strong>Eyes</strong>, for <strong>example</strong>, which is using <strong>AI</strong> to discover the <strong>secrets</strong> behind successful guide dogs. By taking <strong>advantage</strong> of natural <strong>language processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>) on structured and unstructured <strong>data</strong>, the <strong>system</strong> they’re using is trained to find <strong>correlations</strong> to successful <strong>dogs</strong> among genetic, <strong>health</strong>, <strong>temperament</strong>, and environmental <strong>factors—and</strong> the technology continues to learn and get better. By using <strong>AI</strong>, Guiding <strong>Eyes</strong> has seen a 10<strong>% increase</strong> in guide <strong>dog graduation</strong> <strong>rates</strong>, helping the <strong>organization</strong> meet the growing <strong>demand</strong> for guide dogs. There are many other <strong>examples</strong> of <strong>AI</strong> being used for the <strong>betterment</strong> of society. For <strong>example</strong>, <strong>PAWS</strong> is an <strong>organization</strong> that uses <strong><strong>machine</strong></strong> learning to predict where <strong>poachers</strong> may strike, or <strong>Dr. Eric Elster</strong>, who worked with the <strong>Walter Reed National Military Medical Center</strong> to apply <strong><strong>machine</strong></strong> learning <strong>techniques</strong> to improve the <strong>treatment</strong> of <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>service</strong> <strong>members</strong> injured in combat. Best <strong>practices</strong> for getting started
These are a just a few <strong>ideas</strong> for how <strong>AI</strong> can be used for social <strong>good—</strong> there are still plenty of opportunities out there. The <strong>challenge</strong> is how to get starte<strong>d</strong>, so here are three best <strong>practices</strong> I’<strong>d</strong> like to <strong>share</strong> to help <strong>people</strong> who want to embark on this journey. First, build your <strong>understanding</strong> of what <strong>AI</strong> is and is not through great online <strong>learning</strong>, such as <strong>Intro</strong> to <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, led by <strong>Peter Norvig</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Thrun</strong>, on Udacity. Second, think differently. AI is a different computing model. Instead of thinking about <strong>use</strong> <strong>cases</strong> and <strong>scenarios</strong>, really focus on the problem you want to solve. Think more “ideal scenario” on how to best develop a <strong>solution</strong>, and then see if a <strong>machine</strong> can be trained to do this work. Let’s consider personalized <strong>education</strong>, particularly reading <strong>comprehension</strong> (which has shown to have a tremendous <strong>impact</strong> on a <strong>child</strong>’s long-term <strong>education</strong>al <strong>performance</strong> across all subjects). With a traditional <strong>use case approach</strong>, we would probably try to develop a general <strong>framework</strong> that would help in a <strong>handful</strong> of scenarios. Now, Learning Ovations has thought about the more ideal scenario. They have realized there are too many possible <strong>scenarios</strong> to <strong>program</strong> or for a general framework to even cover. Instead, they<strong>’</strong>re <strong>training</strong> <strong>AI</strong> to assess each <strong>child</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s performance</strong> (across traditional <strong>metrics</strong> and some new <strong>ones</strong>) as a <strong>tool</strong> for <strong>educators</strong> and parents. In <strong>addition</strong>, they<strong>’</strong>re creating an AI-powered <strong>recommendation engine</strong> based on each individual <strong>school</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s curriculum</strong> to provide another <strong>tool</strong> for <strong>educators</strong> to create a customized <strong>reading program</strong> for each student. Thus, Learning Ovations thought differently on how to personalized education. Third, set aside preconceived notions. There are <strong>things</strong> that <strong><strong>people</strong></strong> are better than <strong>machines</strong> at doing, but there are <strong>things</strong> <strong>machines</strong> are better than <strong><strong>people</strong></strong> at doing—some of which may be surprising. For <strong>example</strong>, <strong>people</strong> seem to be more <strong>honest</strong> in sharing <strong>health</strong> or financial <strong>information</strong> with a <strong>machine</strong> than a <strong>person</strong> because they don’t worry about being judged. This typically means the <strong>machine</strong> gets more accurate <strong>data</strong> to provide recommendations. Thus, recognizing that a <strong>machine</strong> might be as capable in some <strong>areas</strong> could unlock whole new capabilities. When it comes to <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>invention</strong>, and social <strong>good</strong>, the possibilities are endless. <strong>Technology</strong> will only continue to become more advanced, creating new <strong>opportunities</strong> to fix societal <strong>problems</strong> related to <strong>health</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, <strong>conservation</strong>, accessibility, and much more. If you’re <strong>thinking</strong> of jumping into <strong>AI</strong> for good, just remember the most important <strong>rule</strong>: think differently. <strong>Continue</strong> reading <strong>Thinking</strong> beyond <strong>bots</strong>: How <strong>AI</strong> can drive social impact.</body>
