    <body>The Oâ€™Reilly <strong>Data Show</strong> Podcast: <strong><strong>Jerry Overton</strong></strong> on organizing <strong><strong>data</strong> teams</strong>, agile <strong>experimentation</strong>, and the <strong>importance</strong> of <strong>ethics</strong> in <strong>data</strong> <strong>science.In</strong> this <strong>episode</strong> of the <strong>Data Show</strong>, I spoke with <strong><strong>Jerry Overton</strong></strong>, senior <strong>principal</strong> and distinguished <strong>technologist</strong> at DXC Technology. I wanted the <strong>perspective</strong> of <strong>someone</strong> who works across <strong>industries</strong> and with a <strong>variety</strong> of companies.
