    <body>The two <<strong>s</strong>trong>po<strong>s</strong>ition<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> are not interchangeable—and <<strong>s</strong>trong>mi<strong>s</strong>perception<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> of their <<strong>s</strong>trong>role<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> can hurt <<strong>s</strong>trong>team<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> and <<strong>s</strong>trong>compromi<strong>s</strong>e productivity.It</<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>’</<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong> important to under<strong>s</strong>tand the difference<strong>s</strong> between a <strong>data</strong> <strong>engineer</strong> and a <strong>data</strong> <strong>s</strong>cienti<strong>s</strong>t. Misunderstanding or not knowing these <strong>differences</strong> are making <strong>teams</strong> fail or underperform with big data. A key <strong>misunderstanding</strong> is the <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> of each position. I think some of these <strong>misconceptions</strong> come from the <strong>diagrams</strong> that are used to describe <strong>data scientists</strong> and data engineers. Figure 1. Overly simplistic <strong>venn diagram</strong> with <strong>data scientists</strong> and data engineers. Illustration by Jesse Anderson. <strong>Venn</strong> <strong>diagrams</strong> like <strong>Figure</strong> 1 oversimplify the complex positions and how they’re different. It makes the two positions seem interchangeable. Yes, both positions work on big data. However, what each <strong>position</strong> does to create <strong>value</strong> or <strong>data pipelines</strong> with big data is very different. This <strong>difference</strong> comes from the <strong>base</strong> <strong>skills</strong> of each position. What are data scientists and data engineers? When I work with <strong>organizations</strong> on their <strong>team</strong> <strong>structures</strong>, I don’<strong>t use</strong> a <strong>Venn</strong> <strong>diagram</strong> to illustrate the <strong>relationship</strong> between a <strong>data</strong> <strong>engineer</strong> and a <strong>data</strong> scientist. I draw the diagram as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. <strong>Diagram</strong> showing the <strong>core</strong> <strong>competencies</strong> of <strong>data scientists</strong> and <strong>data engineers</strong> and their <strong>overlapping</strong> skills. <strong>Illustration</strong> by <strong>Jesse Anderson</strong> and the Big Data Institute. <strong>Data</strong> <strong><strong>scientists</strong></strong>’ <strong>skills</strong>
At their <strong>core</strong>, <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong>scientists</strong></strong> have a <strong>math</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong> <strong>background</strong> (sometimes physics). Out of this math background, they’re creating advanced analytics. On the extreme <strong>end</strong> of this applied <strong>math</strong>, they’re creating <strong>machine learning</strong> <strong>models</strong> and artificial intelligence. Just like their <strong>software engineering</strong> <strong>counterparts</strong>, <strong>data scientists</strong> will have to interact with the business side. This includes understanding the domain enough to make insights. <strong>Data scientists</strong> are often tasked with analyzing <strong>data</strong> to help the <strong><strong>business</strong></strong>, and this requires a <strong>level</strong> of <strong><strong>business</strong></strong> acumen. Finally, their <strong>results</strong> need to be given to the <strong>business</strong> in an understandable fashion. This requires the <strong>ability</strong> verbally and visually communicate complex <strong>results</strong> and <strong>observations</strong> in a <strong>way</strong> that the business can understand and act on them. My one <strong>sentence definition</strong> of a <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>scientist</strong></strong> is: a <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>scientist</strong></strong> is <strong>someone</strong> who has augmented their <strong>math</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong> background with programming to analyze <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> and create applied <strong>math</strong>ematical models. A common <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist trait</strong> is that they’<strong>ve</strong> picked up programming out of <strong>necessity</strong> to accomplish what they couldn’t do otherwise. When I talk to data scientists, this is a common thing they tell me. In <strong>order</strong> to accomplish a more complicated <strong>analysis</strong> or because of an <strong>otherwise</strong> insurmountable <strong>problem</strong>, they learned how to program. Their <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>system creation</strong> skills aren<strong>’</strong>t the <strong>levels</strong> that you<strong>’</strong>d see from a <strong>programmer</strong> or data engineer—nor should they be. <strong>Data</strong> <strong><strong>engineers</strong></strong>’ <strong>skills</strong>
At their <strong>core</strong>, <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong>engineers</strong></strong> have a programming background. This <strong>background</strong> is generally in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong>, or Python. They have an <strong>emphasis</strong> or <strong>specialization</strong> in distributed <strong>systems</strong> and big data. A <strong>data engineer</strong> has advanced <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>system creation</strong> skills. My one <strong>sentence definition</strong> of a <strong><strong>data engineer</strong></strong> is: a <strong><strong>data engineer</strong></strong> is <strong>someone</strong> who has specialized their <strong>skills</strong> in creating <strong>software</strong>
<strong>solutions</strong> around big data. Using these <strong>engineering</strong> <strong>skills</strong>, they create data pipelines. Creating a <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong>pipeline</strong> may sound easy or trivial, but at big <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong>scale</strong>, this means bringing together 10-30 different big <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> technologies. More importantly, a <strong>data engineer</strong> is the <strong>one</strong> who understands and chooses the <strong>right</strong> <strong>tools</strong> for the job. A <strong>data engineer</strong> is the <strong>one</strong> who understands the various <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong> in-depth, and how to combine them to create <strong>solutions</strong> to enable a <strong>company</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s business</strong> processes with data pipelines. In my <<strong>s</strong>trong>experience</<strong>s</strong>trong>, a <<strong>s</strong>trong>data engineer</<strong>s</strong>trong> i<strong>s</strong> only tangentially involved in the <<strong>s</strong>trong>operation<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> of the <<strong>s</strong>trong>clu<strong>s</strong>ter</<strong>s</strong>trong> (in <<strong>s</strong>trong>contra<strong>s</strong>t</<strong>s</strong>trong> to what<<strong>s</strong>trong>’</<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong> <strong>s</strong>aid about <<strong>s</strong>trong>data engineer</<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong> here). Though some <strong>data</strong> <strong>science</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> really require a <strong>DevOps</strong> or <strong>DataOps</strong> set up, the <strong>majority</strong> of <strong>technologies</strong> don't. Just like with most <strong>programers</strong>, I wouldn't allow them direct <strong>access</strong> to the production system. That's primarily the <strong>job</strong> for <strong>system</strong> <strong>administrators</strong> or DevOps. Overlapping <strong>skills</strong>
There is an <strong>overlap</strong> between a <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> and a <strong>data</strong> engineer. However, the <strong>overlap</strong> happens at the ragged <strong>edges</strong> of each one’s abilities. For example, they overlap on analysis. However, a <<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>data</<strong>s</strong>trong></<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong> <<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>cienti<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>t</<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>’</<strong>s</strong>trong></<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> analytic<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>kill<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> will be far more advanced than a <<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>data</<strong>s</strong>trong></<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong>engineer</<strong>s</strong>trong><<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>’</<strong>s</strong>trong></<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> analytic<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>kill<<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>. A <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineer</strong> can do some basic to intermediate <strong>level</strong> <strong><strong>analytics</strong></strong>, but will be hard pressed to do the advanced <strong><strong>analytics</strong></strong> that a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientist does. Both a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>scientist</strong> and a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineer overlap</strong> on programming. However, a <<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>data</<strong>s</strong>trong></<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong>engineer</<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>’</<strong>s</strong>trong></<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong> programming</<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>kill<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> are well beyond a <<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>data</<strong>s</strong>trong></<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>cienti<strong>s</strong>t</<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>’</<strong>s</strong>trong></<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong> programming</<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>kill<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong>. Having a <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> create a <strong>data</strong> pipeline is at the far <strong>edge</strong> of their <strong>skills</strong>, but is the <strong>bread</strong> and <strong>butter</strong> of a <strong>data</strong> engineer. In this <strong>way</strong>, the two <strong>roles</strong> are complementary, with <strong>data engineers</strong> supporting the <strong>work</strong> of data scientists. You’ll <strong>notice</strong> that there is another <strong>overlap</strong> between a <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> and a <strong>data</strong> engineer—that of big <strong>data</strong>. Understanding each <strong>positions</strong>’ <strong>skills</strong> better, you can now understand the overlap. <strong>Data</strong> <strong>engineers</strong> use their <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>systems</strong> <strong>creation</strong> <strong>skills</strong> to create big data pipelines. <strong>Data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> use their more limited <strong>programming</strong> <strong><strong>skills</strong></strong> and apply their advanced <strong>math</strong> <strong><strong>skills</strong></strong> to create advanced <strong>data products</strong> using those existing data pipelines. This <strong>difference</strong> between creating and using <strong>lies</strong> at the <strong>core</strong> of a <strong>team</strong>'s <strong>failure</strong> or <strong>underperforming</strong> with big data. A <strong>team</strong> that expects their <strong><strong>data</strong> scientists</strong> to create the <strong>data</strong> pipelines will be woefully disappointed. When <strong><strong>organizations</strong></strong> get it wrong
It’s unfortunately common for <strong><strong>organizations</strong></strong> to misunderstand the <strong>core</strong> <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>roles</strong> of each position. Some <strong>organizations</strong> believe that a <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> can create <strong>data</strong> pipelines. A <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>scientist</strong> can create a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>pipeline</strong> after a fashion. The <strong>issues</strong> with a <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> creating a <strong>data</strong> pipeline are several fold. <strong>Remember</strong> that a <strong><strong>data</strong> scientist</strong> has only learned <strong>programming</strong> and big <strong>data</strong> out of necessity. They’re smart people and can figure things out—eventually. Crea<strong>t</strong>ing a <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a pipeline isn</s<strong>t</strong>rong><s<strong>t</strong>rong>’</s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong> remo<strong>t</strong>ely <strong>t</strong>heir core compe<strong>t</strong>ency. From the managerial <strong>point</strong> of <strong>view</strong>, the <strong>data</strong> science team will appear stuck. You’ll look around or hear about other <strong>teams</strong> and compare their <strong>progress</strong> to your team’s <strong>progress</strong>. It will appear as if the <strong>data science team isn</strong><strong>’</strong>t performing or greatly under performing. This is an unfair <strong>evaluation</strong> based on misunderstanding the <strong>core competency</strong> of a <strong>data</strong> scientist. <strong>Data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> <strong>d</strong>oing <strong><strong>d</strong>ata</strong> <strong>engineering</strong>
I’ve seen <strong>companies</strong> task their <strong><strong>d</strong>ata</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> with <strong>things</strong> you’<strong>d</strong> have a <strong><strong>d</strong>ata</strong> engineer <strong>d</strong>o. The <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> were running at 20-30% efficiency. The <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a</s<strong>t</strong>rong> <s<strong>t</strong>rong>scien<strong>t</strong>is<strong>t</strong> doesn</s<strong>t</strong>rong><s<strong>t</strong>rong>’</s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong> know <strong>t</strong>hings <strong>t</strong>ha<strong>t</strong> a <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a</s<strong>t</strong>rong> <strong>engineer</strong> knows off <strong>t</strong>he <strong>t</strong>op of <strong>t</strong>heir head. Creating a <strong><strong>data</strong> pipeline isn</strong><strong>’</strong>t an easy <strong>task—it</strong> takes advanced <strong>programming</strong> <strong>skills</strong>, big <strong>data</strong> <strong>framework understanding</strong>, and <strong>systems</strong> creation. These <strong>aren</strong>’t <strong>skills</strong> that an average <strong>data</strong> scientist has. A <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> can acquire these <strong>skills</strong>; however, the <strong>return</strong> on <strong>investment</strong> (<strong>ROI</strong>) on this time spent will rarely pay off. Don’<strong>t misunderstand</strong> me: a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>scientist</strong> does need <strong>programming</strong> and big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> skills, just not at the <strong>levels</strong> that a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineer needs them. There is also the <strong>issue</strong> of <strong>data scientists</strong> being relative <strong>amateurs</strong> in this data pipeline creation. A <strong>data scientist</strong> will make <strong>mistakes</strong> and wrong <strong>choices</strong> that a data engineer would (should) not. A <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a scien<strong>t</strong>is<strong>t</strong></s<strong>t</strong>rong> of<strong>t</strong>en doesn’<strong>t</strong> know or unders<strong>t</strong>and <strong>t</strong>he righ<strong>t</strong> <strong>t</strong>ool for a job. <strong>Everything</strong> will get collapsed to using a single <strong>tool</strong> (usually the wrong one) for every task. The <strong>reality</strong> is that many different <strong>tools</strong> are needed for different jobs. A qualified <strong><strong>data</strong> engineer</strong> will know these, and <strong>data</strong> scientists will often not know them. A recent <strong>example</strong> of this was a <strong>data scientist</strong> using <strong>Apache Spark</strong> to process a <strong>data set</strong> in the 10s of GB. Yes, <strong>Spark</strong> can process that <strong>amount</strong> of data. However, a small data program would have been much, much faster and better. Their <strong>Spark</strong> <strong>job</strong> was taking 10-15 <strong>minutes</strong> to execute, but the small <strong>data</strong> <strong>RDBMS</strong> took 0.01 <strong>seconds</strong> to accomplish the same thing. In <strong>t</strong>his <s<strong>t</strong>rong>case</s<strong>t</strong>rong>, <strong>t</strong>he <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a</s<strong>t</strong>rong> <s<strong>t</strong>rong>scien<strong>t</strong>is<strong>t</strong></s<strong>t</strong>rong> solved <strong>t</strong>he <s<strong>t</strong>rong>problem</s<strong>t</strong>rong> af<strong>t</strong>er a <s<strong>t</strong>rong>fashion</s<strong>t</strong>rong>, bu<strong>t</strong> didn<s<strong>t</strong>rong>’</s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong> unders<strong>t</strong>and wha<strong>t</strong> <strong>t</strong>he righ<strong>t</strong> <strong>t</strong>ool for <strong>t</strong>he job was. <<strong>s</strong>trong>Time<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> that 15 <<strong>s</strong>trong>minute<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> <strong>s</strong>pent running that <<strong>s</strong>trong>job</<strong>s</strong>trong> by 16 <<strong>s</strong>trong>time<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> in a <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>day</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> (that’<strong>s</strong> on the low <strong>end</strong> for analy<strong>s</strong>i<strong>s</strong>), and your <strong>data</strong> <strong>s</strong>cienti<strong>s</strong>t i<strong>s</strong> <strong>s</strong>p<strong>end</strong>ing four hour<strong>s</strong> a <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>day</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> waiting becau<strong>s</strong>e they’re u<strong>s</strong>ing the wrong <strong>tool</strong> for the <<strong>s</strong>trong>job</<strong>s</strong>trong>. A<strong>t</strong> ano<strong>t</strong>her <s<strong>t</strong>rong>organiza<strong>t</strong>ion</s<strong>t</strong>rong>, <strong>t</strong>heir <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a scien<strong>t</strong>is<strong>t</strong>s</s<strong>t</strong>rong> didn’<strong>t</strong> have any da<strong>t</strong>a <strong>engineering</strong> resources. The <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> would work on the <strong>problems</strong> until they got stuck on a <strong>data</strong> engineering problem they couldn’t solve. They’d <strong>report</strong> back to the <strong>business</strong> that they couldn’t finish things and there it sat, half-finished. This led to the <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> wasting their <strong>time</strong> up to that <strong>point</strong>, and left, by their <strong>estimate</strong>, <strong>millions</strong> of <strong>dollars</strong> on the <strong>table</strong> because <strong>things</strong> couldn’t be finished. A more worrisome <strong>manifestation</strong> of having a <strong><strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong></strong> do a <strong><strong>data</strong> engineer</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s work</strong> is that the <strong><strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong></strong> will get frustrated and quit. I’ve talked to many <strong><strong>data</strong> scientists</strong> at various <strong>organizations</strong> who were doing <strong>data</strong> engineer work. The <strong>conversation</strong> is always the <strong>same—the</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>scientist</strong> <strong>complains</strong> that they came to the <strong>company</strong> to <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science work</strong>, not <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineering work. They’ll do <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineering work</strong> in a <strong>pinch</strong> to get <strong>something</strong> done, but having a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientist do <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineer work will drive them crazy. They will quit and you will have 3-6 <strong>months</strong> to get your <strong>data</strong> engineering act together. I talk more about these issues in another post. <strong>Ratios</strong> of <strong><strong>data engineers</strong></strong> to data <strong>scientists</strong>
<strong>A</strong> common <strong>issue</strong> is to figure out the <strong>ratio</strong> of <strong><strong>data engineers</strong></strong> to data <strong>scientists</strong>. The general <strong>things</strong> to consider when choosing a <strong>ratio</strong> is how complex the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong><strong>pipeline</strong></strong> is, how mature the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong><strong>pipeline</strong></strong> is, and the <strong>level</strong> of <strong>experience</strong> on the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineering team. Having more <strong>data scientists</strong> than <strong>data engineers</strong> is generally an issue. It typically means that an <strong>organization</strong> is having their <strong><strong>data</strong> scientists</strong> do <strong>data</strong> engineering. As I’ve shown, this leads to all sorts of problems. A common <strong>starting point</strong> is 2-3 <strong>data engineers</strong> for every data scientist. For some <strong>organizations</strong> with more complex <strong><strong>data</strong> engineering</strong> <strong>requirements</strong>, this can be 4-5 <strong><strong>data</strong> engineers</strong> per <strong>data</strong> scientist. This includes <strong>organizations</strong> where <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineering</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> are in different <strong>reporting</strong> structures. You need more <strong>data engineers</strong> because more <strong>time</strong> and <strong>effort</strong> is needed to create <strong>data pipelines</strong> than to create the <strong>ML/AI</strong> portion. I talk more about how <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineering</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> <strong>teams</strong> should interact with each other in my <strong>book</strong> Data Engineering Teams. <strong>Data</strong> <strong>Engineers</strong> doing <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong>
<strong>A</strong> far less common <strong>case</strong> is when a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineer starts doing <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong>. There is an upward <strong>push</strong> as <strong>data engineers</strong> start to improve their <strong>math</strong> and statistics skills. This upward <strong>push</strong> is becoming more common as <strong>data</strong> science becomes more standardized. It’s leading to a <strong>brand</strong> new <strong>type</strong> of engineer. The <strong>need</strong> for <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong>
Let’s <strong>face it—data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> come from academic backgrounds. They usually have a <strong>Ph.D.</strong> or <strong>master</strong>'s degree. The <strong>issue</strong> is that they’d rather write a <strong>paper</strong> on a <strong>problem</strong> than get <strong>something</strong> into production. Other <strong>times</strong>, their <strong>programming</strong> <strong>abilities</strong> only extend to creating <strong><strong>something</strong></strong> in <strong><strong>R</strong>. Putting</strong> <strong><strong>something</strong></strong> written in <strong>R</strong> into <strong>production</strong> is an issue unto itself. They don’<strong>t</strong> <strong>t</strong>hink in <strong>t</strong>erms of crea<strong>t</strong>ing sys<strong>t</strong>ems, like an engineer. The general <strong>issue</strong> with <strong>data scientists</strong> is that they’re not <strong>engineers</strong> who put <strong>things</strong> into <strong>production</strong>, create <strong>data pipelines</strong>, and expose those <strong>AI/ML</strong> results. To deal with the <strong>disparity</strong> between an academic <strong>mindset</strong> and the <strong>need</strong> to put <strong>something</strong> in <strong>production</strong>, we’re seeing a new <strong>type</strong> of engineer. Right now, this <strong>engineer</strong> is mostly seen in the <strong>U.S. Their</strong> <strong>title</strong> is <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong>. Figure 3. <strong>Diagram</strong> <strong>showing</strong> where a <strong>machine</strong> learning engineer <strong>fits</strong> with a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>scientist</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineer. <strong>Illustration</strong> by <strong>Jesse Anderson</strong> and the Big Data Institute. <strong>Machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> primarily come from <strong>data</strong> <strong>engineering</strong> backgrounds. They’re cross-trained enough to become <strong>proficient</strong> at both <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineering</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> science. A less common <strong>route</strong> is for a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>scientist</strong> to <strong>cross-train</strong> on the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineering side. My one <strong>sentence definition</strong> of a <strong><strong>machine</strong></strong> learning <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong> is: a <strong><strong>machine</strong></strong> learning <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong> is <strong>someone</strong> who sits at the <strong>crossroads</strong> of <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> and <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong>ing, and has <strong>proficiency</strong> in both <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong>ing and <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong>science</strong>. As you looked at <strong>Figure</strong> 2, you probably wondered what happens to the <strong>gap</strong> between <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> engineering. This exactly where the <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> <strong>fits</strong> in, as shown in Figure 3. They’re the <strong>conduit</strong> between the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>pipeline</strong> a <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineer</strong> <strong>creates</strong> and what the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientist <strong>creates</strong>. A <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> is responsible for taking what a <strong><strong>data scientist</strong></strong> finds or <strong>creates</strong> and making it <strong>production worthy</strong> (it<strong>’</strong>s worth noting that most of what a <strong><strong>data scientist</strong></strong> <strong>creates</strong> isn<strong>’</strong>t <strong>production worthy</strong> and is mostly hacked together enough to work). The <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong><strong>’</strong>s <strong>job</strong> primarily is to create the last <strong>mile</strong> of the <strong>data</strong> science pipeline. This might entail several parts. It might be rewriting a <strong>data scientist</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s code</strong> from <strong>R/Python</strong> to Java/Scala. It might be optimizing the <strong>ML/AI</strong> <strong>code</strong> from a <strong>software engineering point</strong> of <strong>view</strong> that the <strong>data</strong> scientist wrote so it runs well (or runs at all). The <s<strong>t</strong>rong>machine</s<strong>t</strong>rong> learning <s<strong>t</strong>rong>engineer</s<strong>t</strong>rong> has <strong>t</strong>he <s<strong>t</strong>rong>engineer</s<strong>t</strong>rong>ing background <strong>t</strong>o enforce <strong>t</strong>he necessary <s<strong>t</strong>rong>engineer</s<strong>t</strong>rong>ing discipline on a <s<strong>t</strong>rong>field</s<strong>t</strong>rong> (<s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a</s<strong>t</strong>rong> <s<strong>t</strong>rong>science</s<strong>t</strong>rong>) <strong>t</strong>ha<strong>t</strong> isn’<strong>t</strong> known for i<strong>t</strong>s <strong>adherence</strong> <strong>t</strong>o good <s<strong>t</strong>rong>engineer</s<strong>t</strong>rong>ing principles. A <strong>model</strong> running in <strong>production</strong> requires <strong>care</strong> and <strong>feeding</strong> that <strong>software</strong> doesn’t. A <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>model</strong> can go stale and start giving out incorrect or distorted results. This could be from the <strong>nature</strong> of the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>changing</strong>, new <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, or a malicious attack. Either <strong>way</strong>, the <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> is on the <strong>lookout</strong> for <strong>changes</strong> in their <strong>model</strong> that would require <strong>retraining</strong> or tweaking. <strong>Machine</strong> learning <strong><strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong>s</strong> and <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong>s</strong>
The <strong>transition</strong> of <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong> to <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong> is a slow-moving process. To be honest, we’re going to see similar <strong>revisions</strong> to what a <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> is to what we’ve seen with the <strong>definition</strong> of <strong>data</strong> scientists. To explain what I mean by slow <strong>moving</strong>, I will <strong>share</strong> the <strong>experience</strong> of those who I’ve seen make the <strong>transition</strong> from <strong>data</strong> <strong>engineer</strong> to <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong>. They’ve <strong>spent</strong> <strong>years</strong> doing <strong>development work</strong> as a <strong>software engineer</strong> and then <strong>data</strong> engineer. They’ve always had an <strong>interest</strong> in <strong>statistics</strong> or math. Other <strong>times</strong>, they just got bored with the <strong>constraints</strong> of being a data engineer. Either <strong>way</strong>, this <strong>transition</strong> took years. I’m not seeing <strong>people</strong> become <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> after taking a <strong>beginning</strong> stats <strong>class</strong> or after taking a <strong>beginning</strong> <strong>machine</strong> learning course. As I much as I razz the <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> for being <strong>academics</strong>, <strong>data</strong> engineers aren’t the right people, either. An <strong>engineer</strong> loves <strong>trues</strong> and <strong>falses</strong>, the black and white, and the <strong>ones</strong> and <strong>zeros</strong> of the the world. They don’t like uncertainty. Wi<strong>t</strong>h <s<strong>t</strong>rong>machine learning</s<strong>t</strong>rong>, <strong>t</strong>here is a <s<strong>t</strong>rong>level</s<strong>t</strong>rong> of <s<strong>t</strong>rong>uncer<strong>t</strong>ain<strong>t</strong>y</s<strong>t</strong>rong> of <strong>t</strong>he <s<strong>t</strong>rong>model</s<strong>t</strong>rong><s<strong>t</strong>rong>’</s<strong>t</strong>rong><s<strong>t</strong>rong>s guess</s<strong>t</strong>rong> (<s<strong>t</strong>rong>engineers</s<strong>t</strong>rong> don<s<strong>t</strong>rong>’</s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong> like guessing, ei<strong>t</strong>her). Unlike most <strong><strong>engineer</strong>s</strong>, a <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> can straddle the <strong>certainty</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineer</strong>ing and the un<strong>certainty</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> science. The increasing <strong>value</strong> of <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong>
The <strong>bar</strong> for doing <strong>data</strong> science is gradually decreasing. The best practices are gradually being fleshed out. The most common algorithms are known. Even better, someone has already coded and optimized these algorithms. This increasing <strong>maturity</strong> is making it easier for both <strong>data scientists</strong> and <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> to put <strong>things</strong> in production without having to code them. We’<strong>re</strong> also seeing <strong>data</strong> <strong>science</strong> become a mo<strong>re</strong> automatic and automated process. Google’<strong>s</strong> <strong>AutoML</strong> i<strong>s</strong> one <strong>s</strong>uch <strong>trend</strong> where it will find the be<strong>s</strong>t <strong>algorithm</strong> for you automatically and give re<strong>s</strong>ult<strong>s</strong> without requiring the <strong>work</strong> of a full-fledged <strong>data</strong> <strong>s</strong>cienti<strong>s</strong>t. <strong>DataRobot</strong> is another <strong>technology</strong> that is automating the <strong>process</strong> of finding the <strong>right</strong> <strong>data</strong> <strong>science algorithm</strong> for the <strong>data</strong>. It will also aid the <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> in putting that <strong>algorithm</strong> into production. These <s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong>ools</s<strong>t</strong>rong> aren’<strong>t</strong> going <strong>t</strong>o replace <strong>hardcore</strong> da<strong>t</strong>a <strong>science</strong>, bu<strong>t</strong> i<strong>t</strong> will allow da<strong>t</strong>a scien<strong>t</strong>is<strong>t</strong>s <strong>t</strong>o focus on <strong>t</strong>he more difficul<strong>t</strong> par<strong>t</strong>s of da<strong>t</strong>a <strong>science</strong>. It will allow machine learning engineers to become more and more productive. We’ll see a gradually increasing <strong>amount</strong> of offloading to <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> of algorithms. I’m <strong>torn</strong> on what <strong>level</strong> of <strong>productivity</strong> we should expect from <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> in the future. To grossly oversimplify <strong>things</strong>, will <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> be the <strong>Wordpress</strong> <strong>configurators</strong> to their web <strong>developer</strong> counterparts? In this <strong>scenario</strong>, a <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> can be productive with very known and standard <strong>use</strong> <strong>cases</strong>, and only a <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientist</strong> can handle the really custom work. Or will <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> be the database administrator reborn? Given an in-depth <strong>knowledge</strong> of the <strong><strong>model</strong></strong>, they can use a <strong>known</strong>, cookie-cutter <strong>approach</strong> to configure a <strong><strong>model</strong></strong>, get correct <strong>results</strong> 50-80<strong>%</strong> of the <strong>time</strong>, and that’s good enough for what was needed. To get truly accurate <strong>results</strong>, you would need a <strong>data</strong> scientist. The <strong>key</strong> to the <strong>productivity</strong> of <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineers</strong> and <strong>data</strong> <strong>scientists</strong> will be their tools. There<strong>’</strong>s a <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>maturity</strong> now, and that<strong>’</strong>s why I<strong>’</strong>m wondering how productive they<strong>’</strong>ll be in the future. I expect the <strong>bar</strong> for doing <strong>data</strong> science to continue to lower. This will make a <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> able to accomplish more <strong>data</strong> <strong>science</strong> without a massive <strong>increase</strong> in knowledge. I expect the <strong>role</strong> of <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>engineer</strong> to become increasingly common in the <strong>U.S.</strong> and around the world. What to do? Now that you’ve seen the <strong>differences</strong> between <strong>data scientists</strong> and <strong>data engineers</strong>, you need to go back through your <strong>organization</strong> and see where you need to make changes. This is a <strong>change</strong> I’<strong>ve</strong> helped other <strong>organizations</strong> accomplish, and they’<strong>ve</strong> seen tremendous results. In <strong>cases</strong> where the <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>science</strong> group</strong> seemed stuck and unable to perform, we created <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>engineering</strong></strong> <strong><strong>teams</strong></strong>, showed the <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> and <strong><strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>engineering</strong></strong> <strong><strong>teams</strong></strong> how to work together, and put the <strong>right</strong> processes in place. These <strong>changes</strong> took the <strong>data science team</strong> from 20-30<strong>% productivity</strong> to 90%. The <strong>teams</strong> were able to do more with the same <strong>number</strong> of people. The <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a</s<strong>t</strong>rong> <s<strong>t</strong>rong>scien<strong>t</strong>is<strong>t</strong>s</s<strong>t</strong>rong> were happier because <strong>t</strong>hey weren’<strong>t</strong> doing <s<strong>t</strong>rong>da<strong>t</strong>a</s<strong>t</strong>rong> engineering. <strong>Management</strong> could start delivering <strong>value</strong> against the <strong>promises</strong> of big data. You also met a new <strong>position</strong>, <strong>machine</strong> learning engineer. As your <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>engineering</strong> <strong>teams</strong> mature, you’ll want to check the <strong>gaps</strong> between the <strong>teams</strong>. You may need to promote a <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong> on their <strong>way</strong> to becoming a <strong><strong>machine</strong></strong> learning <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong> or hire a <strong><strong>machine</strong></strong> learning <strong><strong>engineer</strong></strong>. Finally, most <strong>problems</strong> with big <strong>data</strong> are <strong>people</strong> and <strong>team</strong> issues. They are not technical issues (at least not initially). <strong>Technology</strong> usually gets blamed because it’s far easier to blame <strong>technology</strong> than to look <strong>inward</strong> at the team itself.

Take an honest <strong>look</strong> at your <strong>team</strong> and your organization to see where you need to change.
