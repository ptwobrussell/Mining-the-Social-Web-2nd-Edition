    <body><strong>Dubsteganography</strong>, <strong>Parsing History</strong>, <strong>Hackin</strong>' the <strong>Jack</strong> In, and Model Bias

Hide Data in <strong>Dubstep Drops</strong> -- the blog post shows how to use it. <strong>Skrillex</strong> <strong>meets</strong> steganography! Parsing Timeline -- wonderfully detailed, yet it reads almost chatty. Interesting and informative. Securing <strong>Wireless</strong> <strong>Neurostimulators</strong> -- a <strong>hack</strong> and <strong>discussion</strong> of the <strong>risk</strong> of <strong>insecure</strong> implantable medical <strong>devices</strong> that interface with the brain. (via <strong>Paper</strong> a <strong>Day</strong>)

<strong>Text Embedding Models Contain Bias</strong> (<strong>Google</strong>) -- great to see this making its <strong>way</strong> to <strong>research</strong> <strong>outputs</strong>, instead of being the <strong>province</strong> of <strong>damage control</strong> and bad PR. The <strong>Developers</strong> <strong>section</strong> of the <strong>Semantic Experiences</strong> microsite <strong>talks</strong> about "unwanted <strong>associations</strong>": In <strong>Semantris</strong>, the <strong>list</strong> of <strong>words</strong> we're showing are hand curated and reviewed. To the <strong>extent</strong> possible, we've excluded <strong>topics</strong> and <strong>entities</strong> that we think particularly invite unwanted <strong>associations</strong>, or can easily complement them as inputs. In <strong>Talk</strong> to <strong>Books</strong>, while we can't manually vet each <strong>sentence</strong> of 100,000 <strong><strong>volumes</strong></strong>, we use a <strong>popularity measure</strong> which increases the <strong>proportion</strong> of <strong><strong>volumes</strong></strong> that are published by professional <strong>publishing</strong> houses. There are additional measures that could be taken. For <strong>example</strong>, a <strong>toxicity <strong>classifier</strong></strong> or sensitive <strong>topics</strong> <strong>classifier</strong> could determine when the <strong>input</strong> or the <strong>output</strong> is <strong>something</strong> that may be objectionable or <strong>party</strong> to an unwanted association. We recommend taking bias-impact <strong>mitigation</strong> <strong>steps</strong> when crafting <strong>end-user</strong> <strong>applications</strong> built with these models. Check out the "<strong>Law</strong>, <strong>ethics</strong>, and <strong>governance</strong>" <strong>sessions</strong> at the <strong>Strata Data Conference</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, May 21-24, 2018. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 17 April 2018.</body>
