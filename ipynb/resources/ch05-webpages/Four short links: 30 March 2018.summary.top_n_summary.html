Data Defenders -- game for grade 4-6 that teaches children and pre-teens the concept of personal information and its economic value, and introduces them to ways to manage and protect their personal information on the websites and apps they enjoy.</strong> <strong>(via BoingBoing)

Readings in Applied Data Science -- pointers to interesting papers, via Hadley Wickham's Stanford class.</strong>

<strong>COST: Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread -- The COST of a given platform for a given problem is the hardware configuration required before the platform outperforms a competent single-threaded implementation.</strong> <strong>[...] We survey measurements of data-parallel systems recently reported in SOSP and OSDI, and find that many systems have either a surprisingly large COST, often hundreds of cores, or simply underperform one thread for all their reported configurations.</strong>


<strong>Finding Alternative Musical Scales -- is there nothing that AI cannot improve/ruin?</strong> We search for alternative musical scales that share the main advantages of classical scales: pitch frequencies that bear simple ratios to each other, and multiple keys based on an underlying chromatic scale with tempered tuning. We conduct the search by formulating a constraint satisfaction problem that is well suited for solution by constraint programming. We find that certain 11-note scales on a 19-note chromatic stand out as superior to all others. These scales enjoy harmonic and structural possibilities that go significantly beyond what is available in classical scales and therefore provide a possible medium for innovative musical composition.
