    <body><strong>Metrics</strong> and <strong>Incentives</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> as <strong>Fire Starter</strong>, <strong>Meeting Mastery</strong>, and Weird Chart Types

Heart Surgeons Avoid Difficult Operations to <strong>Avoid Poor Performance Rankings</strong> -- <strong>Just</strong> under <strong>one-third</strong> of the 115 <strong>specialists</strong> who responded said they had recommended a different <strong>treatment path</strong> to avoid adding another <strong>death</strong> to their score. And 84% said they were aware of other surgeons doing the same. <strong>Reminds</strong> me of <strong>MySociety</strong>'s hard-learned <strong>lessons</strong> with their <strong>MP</strong> <strong>scorecard</strong>, whereby <strong>MP</strong>s would ask pointless <strong>questions</strong> in <strong>Parliament</strong> just to get their numbers up. When <strong>Countries</strong> are <strong>Tinderboxes</strong>, and <strong>Facebook</strong> is a <strong>Match</strong> (<strong>NYT</strong>) -- where <strong>institutions</strong> are weak or undeveloped, <strong>Facebook</strong>â€™s newsfeed can inadvertently amplify dangerous tendencies. Designed to maximize user <strong>time</strong> on <strong>site</strong>, it promotes whatever wins the most attention. <strong>Posts</strong> that tap into negative, primal <strong>emotions</strong> like <strong>anger</strong> or <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>studies</strong> have found, produce the highest engagement, and so proliferate. <strong>Plenty</strong> of horrifying <strong>examples</strong> of <strong>lynchings</strong> and <strong>riots</strong> triggered by <strong>Facebook</strong> posts. <strong>Reflections</strong> (<strong>Matt Webb</strong>) -- Much of any <strong>founder</strong>'s <strong>time</strong> will be spent <strong>meeting</strong> <strong>advisors</strong> and investors.

They should have purpose and outcomes, although these don't necessarily need to be stated. There are a <strong>lot</strong> of small <strong>ways</strong> to make sure attendees don't drift or feel lost. Really fascinating <strong>notes</strong> about how he coaches his <strong>founders</strong> through the incubator program. <strong>Xeno.graphics</strong> -- <strong>weird</strong> but (sometimes) useful charts. Check out the "<strong>Strata Business Summit</strong>" <strong>sessions</strong> at the <strong>Strata Data Conference</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, May 21-24, 2018. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 23 April 2018.</body>
