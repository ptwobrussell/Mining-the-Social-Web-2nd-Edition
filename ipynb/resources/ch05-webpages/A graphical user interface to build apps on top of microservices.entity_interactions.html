    <body>How to enable non-programmer <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong> to create their own <strong>data</strong> <strong>applications.Companies</strong> are increasingly asking their <strong>IT</strong> staffs for rapid <strong>turn-around</strong> on <strong>tasks</strong> that require programming. The most likely <strong>path</strong> to attaining quick <strong>turn-around</strong> would be to let <strong>non-programmers</strong> create their own <strong>applications—an approach</strong> that can be achieved with a <strong>combination</strong> of <strong>microservices</strong>, <strong>APIs</strong>, and graphical <strong>user</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> (GUIs). The <strong>goal</strong> of letting <strong>non-programmers</strong> <strong>manipulate</strong> data is an old one. When <strong>IBM</strong> released early <strong>versions</strong> of the <strong>SQL</strong> <strong>programming language</strong>, they intended it for <strong>business</strong> users. They really expected a mid-level <strong>manager</strong> to sit down in the <strong>morning</strong> and <strong>type</strong> <strong>UPDATE PRODUCT.SPEC SET WIDTH =</strong> 19, <strong>HEIGHT =</strong> 12, <strong>DEPTH</strong> = 4 <strong>WHERE PRODUCT_NUM LIKE</strong> 'GK145<strong>%</strong>' onto a green screen. More realistically, though, <strong>SQL</strong> was hidden behind various <strong>forms</strong> that eventually moved to the web. But these <strong>forms</strong> do not offer the full <strong>power</strong> of the language. Visual <strong>programming</strong>, using some <strong>technique</strong> such as moving <strong>boxes</strong> around a <strong>screen</strong> to create <strong>control</strong> flows, has also been researched for decades. It is best known in <strong>children</strong>'s educational <strong>tools</strong> such as <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>MIT</strong>'s Scratch. The <strong>problem</strong> with trying to create large-scale <strong>applications</strong> using visual <strong><strong>programming</strong>—and</strong> the <strong>reason</strong> I'm guessing that visual <strong>programming</strong> hasn't won a large <strong>user base—is</strong> that <strong>programming</strong>'s <strong>complexity</strong> lies more in the <strong>mind</strong> than in the syntax. Exposing the <strong>complexity</strong> of <strong>control flow</strong> and <strong>math</strong> through <strong>boxes</strong> and <strong>lines</strong> doesn't make it easier than using <strong>words</strong> and punctuation. It may be quite a different <strong>matter</strong>, however, when powerful <strong>chunks</strong> of <strong>functionality</strong>, already hooked up to an <strong>organization</strong>'s <strong>data sets</strong> and <strong>control structure</strong>, are offered in a visual <strong>interface</strong>, also known as a “low-code development platform.” For <strong>instance</strong>, an <strong>auto insurance assessor</strong> can do <strong>something</strong> really useful if she can automate <strong><strong>part</strong></strong> of her <strong>job</strong> by drawing a <strong>line</strong> between <strong>client information</strong> and a <strong>tool</strong> that calculates how much to pay for each <strong><strong>part</strong></strong> of a car. Where do microservices enter the picture? They work at a higher <strong>level</strong> than <strong>function</strong> or library <strong>calls</strong>, offering precise <strong>access</strong> to specific <strong>data</strong> and <strong>services</strong> in the organization. I talked about <strong>microservices</strong> with <strong>Bruno Trimouille</strong>, a senior <strong>marketing executive</strong> at TIBCO Software. He spoke of an <strong>airline</strong> that has <strong>micro<strong>services</strong></strong> for <strong>travel</strong> <strong>services</strong>, <strong>customer profile</strong> <strong>data</strong>, <strong>flight information</strong>, and other <strong>elements</strong> of their workflow. Visual <strong>programming</strong> exposes all these <strong>things</strong> to the average employee. If <strong>someone</strong> in the <strong>luggage department</strong> thinks up an <strong>application</strong> that can find a <strong>bag</strong> more quickly or send a <strong>voucher</strong> to a <strong>customer</strong>'s mobile <strong>phone</strong>, he can hook up <strong>services</strong> to create the <strong>application</strong>. The low-code <strong>application environment</strong> can tap <strong>microservices</strong> to digitize a <strong>process</strong> that previously was done manually, such as submitting <strong>expenses</strong> or getting travel approval. It can also extend an existing <strong>system</strong>, or add some <strong>logic</strong> that stitches two microservices together. As another <strong>example</strong>, <strong>Trimouille</strong> <strong>points</strong> to the <strong>problem</strong> of repricing in insurance. When an <strong>auto body shop</strong> takes apart a <strong>car</strong>, it often discovers new <strong>damage</strong> that the insurance assessor did not originally cover. The <strong>insurance company</strong> can upgrade its <strong>assessment tool</strong> to do repricing quickly and save both <strong>time</strong> and money. Thus, <strong>microservices</strong>, <strong>APIs</strong>, and low-code <strong>application development</strong> may lead to a new <strong>level</strong> of productivity. They could provide <strong>end</strong> <strong>users</strong> with the deep <strong>reach</strong> into their corporate <strong>data</strong> promised by the classic <strong>UPDATE</strong> <strong>statement—but</strong> now backed up by full <strong>insight</strong> into the <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>value</strong> of the <strong>data</strong>. This <strong>post</strong> is a <strong>collaboration</strong> between <strong>O'Reilly</strong> and TIBCO. See our statement of editorial independence. <strong>Continue</strong> reading <strong>A</strong> graphical <strong>user interface</strong> to build <strong>apps</strong> on <strong>top</strong> of microservices.</body>
