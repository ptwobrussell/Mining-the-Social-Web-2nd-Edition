    <body><strong>Deep Learning Learnings</strong>, <strong>Reverse Engineering WhatsApp</strong>, <strong>Database Client</strong>, and Social Science

Lessons Learned Reproducing a Deep <strong>Reinforcement Learning Paper</strong> -- <strong>REALLY</strong> good <strong>retrospective</strong> on eight <strong>months</strong> reproducing a <strong>paper</strong>, with <strong>lots</strong> of <strong>lessons</strong> learned, like starting a <strong>reinforcement learning project</strong>, you should expect to get stuck like you get stuck on a math problem. It’<strong>s</strong> not like my <<strong>s</strong>trong>experience</<strong>s</strong>trong> of programming in general <strong>s</strong>o far where you get <strong>s</strong>tuck but there’<strong>s</strong> u<strong>s</strong>ually a clear <strong>trail</strong> to follow and you can get un<strong>s</strong>tuck within a <strong>couple</strong> of day<strong>s</strong> at mo<strong>s</strong>t. It’s more like when you’re trying to solve a <strong>puzzle</strong>, there are no clear <strong>inroads</strong> into the <strong>problem</strong>, and the only <strong>way</strong> to proceed is to try <strong>things</strong> until you find the key <strong>piece</strong> of <strong>evidence</strong> or get the key spark that lets you figure it out. <strong>Reverse Engineering WhatsApp</strong> -- This <strong>project</strong> intends to provide a complete <strong>description</strong> and <strong>re-implementation</strong> of the <strong>WhatsApp Web API</strong>, which will eventually lead to a custom client. <strong>WhatsApp Web</strong> internally works using <strong>WebSockets</strong>; this project does as well. <strong>DatabaseFlow</strong> -- an open <strong>source</strong> self-hosted <strong>SQL</strong> <strong>client</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong> <strong>server</strong>, and charting <strong>application</strong> that works with your database. <strong>Visualize</strong> <strong>schemas</strong>, <strong>query</strong> <strong>plans</strong>, <strong>charts</strong>, and results. You can run <strong>Database Flow</strong> locally for your own <strong>use</strong>, or install to a shared <strong>server</strong> for the whole team. <strong>Code</strong> and <strong>Data</strong> for the <strong>Social</strong> <strong>Sciences</strong> -- This <strong>handbook</strong> is about translating <strong>insights</strong> from <strong>experts</strong> in <strong>code</strong> and <strong>data</strong> into practical <strong>terms</strong> for empirical social scientists. Check out the "<strong>Data Science</strong> & <strong>Machine Learning</strong>" <strong>sessions</strong> at the <strong>Strata Data Conference</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, May 21-24, 2018. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 10 April 2018.</body>
