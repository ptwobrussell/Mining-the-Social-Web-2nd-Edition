    <body><strong>Strata Data London</strong> will introduce <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong>; <strong>showcase use</strong> <strong>cases</strong>; and highlight the <strong>importance</strong> of <strong>ethics</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>, and security.The growing <strong>role</strong> of <strong>data</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> <strong>cuts</strong> across <strong>domains</strong> and industries. <strong>Companies</strong> continue to use <strong>data</strong> to improve <strong>decision-making</strong> (<strong>business intelligence</strong> and <strong>analytics</strong>) and for <strong>automation</strong> (<strong>machine learning</strong> and AI). At the <strong>Strata Data Conference</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, we’ve assembled a <strong>program</strong> that introduces <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong>, <strong>show<strong>cases</strong></strong> use <strong>cases</strong> across many <strong>industries</strong>, and highlights the <strong>importance</strong> of <strong>ethics</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>, and security. We are bringing back the <strong>Strata Business Summit</strong>, and this <strong>year</strong>, we have two <strong>days</strong> of executive briefings. <strong>Data Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> <strong>sessions</strong> will cover <strong>tools</strong>, <strong>techniques</strong>, and <strong>case</strong> studies. This <strong>year</strong>, we have many <strong>sessions</strong> on <strong>managing</strong> and deploying <strong>models</strong> to <strong>production</strong>, and <strong>applications</strong> of deep <strong>learning</strong> in <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>applications</strong>. This <strong>year</strong>’s <strong>sessions</strong> on <strong>Data Engineering</strong> and <strong>Architecture</strong> showcases streaming and real-time <strong>applications</strong>, along with the <strong>data</strong> <strong>platforms</strong> used at several leading companies. <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong>
The <strong>enforcement date</strong> for the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>) is the <strong>day</strong> after the <strong>end</strong> of the <strong>conference</strong> (<strong>May</strong> 25, 2018) and for the past few <strong>months</strong>, <strong>companies</strong> have been scrambling to learn this new <strong>set</strong> of regulations. We have a tutorial and <strong>sessions</strong> to help <strong>companies</strong> learn how to comply with GDPR. Implementing <strong>data</strong> <strong>security</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> remain foundational, but one of the key <strong>changes</strong> advanced by GDPR—“<strong>privacy</strong>-by-design”—will require <strong>companies</strong> to reassess how they design and architect products. <strong>Security</strong> and <strong>Privacy</strong> <strong><strong>sessions</strong></strong>

Unlocking popular <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong> types</strong>: <strong>Text</strong>, temporal <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, and graphs
The <strong>need</strong> for <strong>scaleout</strong> and streaming <strong>infrastructure</strong> can often be traced back to the <strong>importance</strong> of <strong>text</strong>, temporal <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, and graphs. After one sets up <strong>infrastructure</strong> for collecting, storing, and querying these <strong>data types</strong>, the next <strong>step</strong> is to uncover interesting <strong>patterns</strong> or to use them to make predictions. Over the past <strong>year</strong>, <strong>companies</strong> have been turning to <strong>machine <strong>learning</strong></strong>, in many <strong>cases</strong> to deep <strong>learning</strong>, when faced with large <strong>amounts</strong> of <strong>text</strong>, <strong>graphs</strong>, or temporal data. On the <strong>infrastructure side</strong>, we have <strong>sessions</strong> from <strong>members</strong> of some of the leading <strong>stream processing</strong> and <strong>storage</strong> communities. <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Natural Language</strong> <strong><strong>sessions</strong></strong>

<strong>Data</strong> <strong>platforms</strong>
<strong>How</strong> do some of the best <strong>companies</strong> architect and develop data <strong>platforms</strong> that help accelerate <strong>innovation</strong> and digital transformation? In a <strong>series</strong> of <strong>sessions</strong>, <strong>companies</strong> will <strong>share</strong> their internal <strong>platforms</strong> for <strong>business intelligence</strong> and machine learning. These are battle-tested <strong>platforms</strong> used in <strong>production</strong>, some at extremely large scale. Many of these <strong><strong>data</strong> platforms</strong> encourage <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>sharing</strong> of <strong>data</strong>, <strong>features</strong>, and models. In <strong>addition</strong>, since we’re very much in an empirical <strong>era</strong> for <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>tools</strong> for running and reproducing <strong>experiments</strong>, and for exploring the <strong>space</strong> of algorithms, are essential. <strong>Security</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> become even more critical in <strong>light</strong> of the upcoming <strong>enforcement date</strong> for GDPR. <strong>Data Platforms sessions</strong>


<strong>Machine</strong> <strong>learning</strong>: From <strong>data</strong> <strong>preparation</strong> and <strong>integration</strong>, to model <strong>deployment</strong> and <strong>management</strong>
<strong>Media</strong> articles on machine <strong>learning</strong> over emphasize <strong>algorithms</strong> and models. The <strong>reality</strong> is that <strong>model <strong>building</strong></strong> is just one <strong>aspect</strong> of <strong>building</strong> <strong>products</strong> that rely on machine learning. In a vast <strong>majority</strong> of <strong>cases</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong> <strong>applications</strong> require <strong>training</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> (<strong>“</strong>labeled <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> is the new, new oil”). To that <strong>end</strong>, the first <strong>step</strong> is to bring together existing <strong>data sources</strong> and when appropriate, enrich them with other data sets. In most <strong>cases</strong>, <strong>data needs</strong> to be refined and prepared before it’s ready for analytic applications. While <strong>prototypes</strong> are easy to cook up, building <strong>production-grade</strong> <strong>applications</strong> requires serious engineering. <strong>Companies</strong> have come to realize that deploying, <strong>monitoring</strong>, and managing <strong>models</strong> in <strong>production</strong> requires different <strong>skills</strong> and a different mindset. So much so that a new <strong>breed</strong> of <strong>workers</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong> <strong>engineers</strong>, was recently forecasted to be the fastest <strong>growing</strong>, emerging job in 2018.

<strong>Industry-</strong> and domain-specific <strong>tools</strong>, <strong>methods</strong>, and <strong>use</strong> <strong>cases</strong>
The best <strong>way</strong> to understand the <strong>potential</strong> of <strong>data</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> is to see how <strong>companies</strong> are using them in <strong>real-world</strong> applications. One of the great <strong>things</strong> about <strong>Strata Data London</strong> is that one gets to hear <strong>case</strong> <strong>studies</strong> from many different <strong>industries</strong> and countries. You will learn how a <strong>variety</strong> of <strong>companies</strong> from across the <strong>globe</strong> have designed their <strong><strong>data</strong> infrastructures</strong>; how they are incorporating <strong>machine learning</strong>; and how they’re approaching <strong>data</strong> <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and ethics. This <strong>year</strong>, we have <strong>keynotes</strong> and <strong>sessions</strong> on important <strong>topics</strong> in public <strong>policy</strong>, <strong>health care</strong>, <strong>manufacturing</strong>, and many other <strong>sectors</strong> of the economy. Here are some <strong>examples</strong>:
