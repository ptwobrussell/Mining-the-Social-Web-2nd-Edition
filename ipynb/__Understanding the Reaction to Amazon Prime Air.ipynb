    "On Cyber Monday Eve, Jeff Bezos revealed that Amazon may have intentions to one day deliver many of its goods by unmanned aerial vehicles through a service called *Amazon Prime Air* as part of an segment for the television show *60 Minutes*. This notebook explores ~125k tweets from Twitter's firehose that were captured shortly after the announcement and teaches you how you can be equipped to capture interesting data within moments of announcements for your own analysis.\n",

    "Twitter is an ideal source of data that can help you to understand the reaction to newsworthy events, because it has more than 200M active monthly users who tend to use it to frequently share short informal thoughts about anything and everything. Although Twitter offers a Search API that can be used to query for \"historical data\", tapping into the firehose with the Streaming API is a preferred option because it provides you the ability to acquire much larger volumes of data with keyword filters in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous options for storing the data that you acquire from the firehose. A document-oriented database such as <a href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a> makes a fine choice and can provide useful APIs for filtering and analysis. However, we'll opt to simply store the tweets that we fetch from the firehose in a newline-delimited text file, because we'll use the *pandas* library to analyze it as opposed to relying on MongoDB or a comparable option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Should you have preferred to instead sink the data to MongoDB, the *mongoexport* commandline tool could have exported it to a newline delimited format that is exactly the same as what we will be writing to a file. Either way, you're covered."

    "Some of the items in a data frame may be null values, and these null values can wreak all kinds of havoc during analysis. Once you understand why they exist, it's wise to filter them out if possible. The null values in this collection of tweets are caused by \"limit notices\", which Twitter sends to tell you that you're being rate-limited. Notice in the columnar output above that the \"limit\" field (which is not typically part of a tweet) appears 16 times. This indicates that we received 16 limit notices and means that there are effectively 16 \"rows\" in our data frame that has null values for all of the fields we'd have expected to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per the Streaming API guidelines, Twitter will only provide up to 1% of the total volume of the firehose, and anything beyond that is filtered out with each \"limit notice\" telling you how many tweets were filtered out. This means that tweets containing \"Amazon\" accounted for at least 1% of the total tweet volume at the time this data was being collected. The next cell shows how to \"pop\" off the column containing the sixteen limit notices and sum up the totals across these limit notices so that we can learn exactly how many tweets were filtered out across the aggregate."
