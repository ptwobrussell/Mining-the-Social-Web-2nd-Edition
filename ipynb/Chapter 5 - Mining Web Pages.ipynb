      "The Louvre of the Industrial Age\n",
      "The Henry Ford is one of the world's great museums, and the world it chronicles is our own.\n",
      "by Tim O'Reilly | @timoreilly | +Tim O'Reilly | July 30, 2010\n",
      "This morning I had the chance to get a tour of The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI, along with Dale Dougherty, creator of Make: and Makerfaire, and Marc Greuther, the chief curator of the museum.  I had expected a museum dedicated to the auto industry, but it’s so much more than that.  As I wrote in my first stunned tweet, “it’s the Louvre of the Industrial Age.”\n",
      "When we first entered, Marc took us to what he said may be his favorite artifact in the museum, a block of concrete that contains Luther Burbank’s shovel, and Thomas Edison’s signature and footprints.  Luther Burbank was, of course, the great agricultural inventor who created such treasures as the nectarine and the Santa Rosa plum. Ford was a farm boy who became an industrialist; Thomas Edison was his friend and mentor. The museum, opened in 1929, was Ford’s personal homage to the transformation of the world that he was so much a part of.  This museum chronicles that transformation.\n",
      "The machines are astonishing – steam engines and coal-fired electric generators as big as houses, the first lathes capable of making other precision lathes (the makerbot of the 19th century), a ribbon glass machine that is one of five that in the 1970s made virtually all of the incandescent lightbulbs in the world, combine harvesters, railroad locomotives, cars, airplanes, even motels, gas stations, an early McDonalds’ restaurant and other epiphenomena of the automobile era.\n",
      "Under Marc’s eye, we also saw the transformation of the machines from purely functional objects to things of beauty.  We saw the advances in engineering — the materials, the workmanship, the design, over a hundred years of innovation.  Visiting The Henry Ford, as they call it, is a truly humbling experience.  I would never in a hundred years have thought of making a visit to Detroit just to visit this museum, but knowing what I know now, I will tell you confidently that it is as worth your while as a visit to Paris just to see the Louvre, to Rome for the Vatican Museum, to Florence for the Uffizi Gallery, to St. Petersburg for the Hermitage, or to Berlin for the Pergamon Museum.  This is truly one of the world’s great museums, and the world that it chronicles is our own.\n",
      "I am truly humbled that the Museum has partnered with us to hold Makerfaire Detroit on their grounds.  If you are anywhere in reach of Detroit this weekend, I heartily recommend that you plan to spend both days there.  You can easily spend a day at Makerfaire, and you could easily spend a day at The Henry Ford.\n",
      "P.S. Here are some of my photos from my visit .  (More to come soon. Can’t upload many as I’m currently on a plane.)\n",

Their collaboration identified and mapped a much wider range of deforestation in much greater detail. With new analysis techniques for satellite imagery, they were able to classify forest topologies within the rainforest. This improved the accuracy of regional assessments, both for their contribution to the surrounding ecosystem and their vulnerability to human damage. They monitored the emergence of unofficial roads that marked new human activity. They modeled the environmental risks posed by agriculture, logging, and ranching to protected areas of the Amazon. They were also able to project future scenarios to help plan a more effective management strategy that balanced human land use with forest preservation.</p><p>Continue reading <a href='https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/returning-to-our-senses'>Returning to our senses.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/YToqMoCVWTM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n",

We’ve seen deep learning used for <a href=\"http://aiweirdness.com/post/160776374467/new-paint-colors-invented-by-neural-network\">naming paint colors</a> (not very successfully), <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-rembrandt-created-347-years-after-the-dutch-masters-death-180958664/\">imitating Rembrandt</a> and other great painters, and <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/inspirational-applications-deep-learning/\">many other applications</a>. Deep learning has been successful in part because, as François Chollet tweeted, “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/987331839839752193\">you can achieve a surprising amount using only a small set of very basic techniques</a>.” In other words, you can accomplish things with deep learning that don’t require you to become an AI expert. Deep learning’s apparent simplicity--the small number of basic techniques you need to know--makes it much easier to “democratize” AI, to build a core of AI developers that don’t have Ph.D.s in applied math or computer science.</p>\r\n",

We can barely agree on the phenomena that we should be explaining away.” Deep learning’s successes are suggestive, but if we can’t figure out why it works, its value as a tool is limited. We can build an army of deep learning developers, but that won’t help much if all we can tell them is, “Here are some tools. Try random stuff. Good luck.”</p>\r\n",

Each neuron is very simple: it takes a number of inputs from previous layers, combines them according to a set of weights, and produces an output that’s passed to the next layer. The network doesn’t really care whether it’s processing images, text, or telemetry. That simplicity, though, is a hint that we’re missing out on a lot of structure that’s inherent in data. Images and texts aren’t the same; they’re structured differently. <a href=\"http://www.earningmyturns.org/2017/06/a-computational-linguistic-farce-in.html\">Languages</a> have a lot of internal structure.

Because it is the case that if you have huge computation and massive amounts of data, you can do a lot ... with a simple learning device. But those learners are extremely bad learners. Human beings are extremely good learners. What we want to do is build AI devices that are also extremely good learners. ...

As someone who organizes AI conferences, I can attest to this: many of the proposals we receive are for standard machine learning applications. The confusion was inevitable: when calling a research project “artificial intelligence” was hardly respectable, we used the term “machine learning.” ML became a shorthand for “the parts of AI that work.” These parts, up to and including deep learning, were basically large-scale data analysis. Now that the tides of buzz have shifted, and everyone wants AI, machine learning applications are AI again.</p>\r\n",

It will require progress in many areas that go well beyond pattern recognition. To build an autonomous vehicle and other true AI applications, we will need significant advances in sensors and other hardware; we will need to learn how to build software for “edge devices,” which includes understanding how to partition problems between the edge devices and some kind of “cloud”; we will need to develop infrastructure for simulation and distributed computation; and we will need to understand how to craft the user experience for truly intelligent devices.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p><strong>Intelligence augmentation (IA):</strong> Tools that are designed to augment human intelligence and capabilities.

These tools might involve high-level reasoning and thought, though current implementations don’t.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p><strong>Intelligent infrastructure (II):</strong> Jordan defines II as “a web of computation, data, and physical entities exist that make human environments more supportive, interesting and safe.” This would include networks to share medical data safely, systems to make transportation safer (including smart cars and smart roads), and many other applications. Intelligent infrastructure is about managing flows of data in ways that support human life.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>What’s most important about Jordan’s argument, though, is that we won’t get either IA or II if we focus solely on deep learning. They are inherently multidisciplinary.

      "<p>Researchers from many institutions are building tools for creating the AI applications of the future. While there is still a lot of work to be done on deep learning, researchers are looking well beyond DL to build the next generation of AI systems. UC Berkeley's RISE Lab has <a href=\"https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2017/EECS-2017-159.pdf\">sketched out a research agenda</a> that involves systems, architectures, and security.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>Ameet Talwalkar’s <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/toward-the-jet-age-of-machine-learning\">recent post</a> lists a number of research directions that should benefit industrial machine learning platforms. Industrial machine learning will have to meet system requirements, such as memory limitations, power budgets, and hard real time; they must be easy to deploy and to update, particularly since data models tend to grow stale over time; and they must be safe. Humans must understand how applications make decisions, along with the likely consequences of those decisions. These applications must take ethics into account.</p>\r\n",

The research agenda for AI needs to take into account fairness and bias, transparency, privacy and user control over data, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-importance-of-transparency-and-user-control-in-machine-learning\">the models built from that data</a>. These issues encompass everything from ethics to design: getting informed consent, and explaining what that consent means, is not a trivial design problem. We’re only starting to understand how these disciplines connect to research in artificial intelligence. Fortunately, we’re seeing increasing interest within the data community in connecting ethics to practice. Events like the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/\">Data For Good Exchange</a> (D4GX), the <a href=\"https://fatconference.org/\">Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</a> (FAT*), and others are devoted to data ethics.</p>\r\n",

In 1903, dramatic flights by the Wright brothers ushered in the Pioneer Age of aviation, and within a decade, there was widespread belief that powered flight would revolutionize transportation and society more generally. Machine learning (ML) today is also rapidly advancing. We have recently witnessed remarkable breakthroughs on important problems including image recognition, speech translation, and natural language processing, and major technology companies are investing billions of dollars to transform themselves into ML-centric organizations. There is a growing conviction that ML holds the key to some of society’s most pressing problems.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>However, this excitement should also be met with caution. For all the enthusiasm that the Wright brothers generated, nearly half a century would pass before widespread commercial aviation finally became a reality. During the Pioneer Age, aviation was largely restricted to private, sport, and military use. Getting to the Jet Age required a series of fundamental innovations in aeronautical engineering—monoplane wings, aluminum designs, turbine engines, stress testing, jumbo jets, etc.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>Simply put, we needed to invent aeronautical engineering before we could transform the aviation industry. Similarly, we need to invent a new kind of engineering to build ML applications. Data-driven software development is radically different from conventional software development, as it targets complex applications domains (e.g., vision, speech, language) and focuses on learned behaviors instead of rule-based operations (e.g., training deep neural networks on massive data sets versus hand-coded if-then-else statements). Currently, very few organizations have the expertise to do this kind of engineering, and we are just scratching the surface of the potential for ML-powered technology. We describe three key challenges of this new development paradigm below.</p>\r\n",

      "<h2>Challenge 1: Efficiency</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"F1\">Modern ML applications typically involve complex models and massive data sets, requiring significant computational and storage resources. For instance, engineers at Google Brain needed more than 250,000 GPU hours to train a neural translation model for a <em>single</em> pair of languages (English and German), which costs about $200,000 on Google Compute Engine.<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In response, a wide range of specialized hardware solutions are being developed (e.g., GPUs, TPUs, massively parallel CPUs, FPGAs) to improve the speed, energy efficiency, and cost of ML-powered applications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>However, effectively leveraging heterogenous hardware will require us to fundamentally redesign ML software itself. In particular, systems-aware algorithms and software are needed (i) to efficiently train models on massively parallel and heterogeneous hardware, and (ii) to satisfy service level agreements (SLAs) related to latency, power consumption, and memory footprint constraints for production deployments. Advances in hardware must be closely coupled with algorithmic and software innovation in order to develop and deploy ML-based applications in a timely and economical fashion.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5dEi7\"><img alt=\"Automation in modern commercial aviation\" width=\"40%\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/talwalkar_figure4-41a732f201d6c773bb89e5267673a740.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Automation is widespread in modern commercial aviation, including plane manufacturing / testing, air traffic control, and even operating planes.

      "<h2>Challenge 2: Automation</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In addition to being computationally intensive, ML-powered applications are incredibly labor-intensive for ML engineers to train, debug, and deploy. First, even selecting the appropriate computational platform is challenging, given the rapidly changing hardware landscape and diverse set of available cloud-based offerings. Second, the quality of an ML model is highly sensitive to hyperparameters; tuning these hyperparameters is crucial for accuracy but is often labor-intensive and expensive in computational cost. Third, utilizing parallel hardware at training time is highly non-trivial. Naively boosting computational power often does not result in meaningful speedups, and fair and effective sharing of cluster resources among users can be challenging.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"F2\">To make things worse, developing ML applications is not a one-shot process: data changes over time, and therefore models and systems must adapt. Diagnosing and updating stale models is challenging, and exacerbated by the surprising difficulty (and sometimes impossibility<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>) of reproducing the behavior of ML applications. These issues are due to many factors, including (i) the statistical or \"fuzzy\" nature of these applications; (ii) the complexity of ML applications (e.g., pipeline jungles<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>); and (iii) ad-hoc development processes in which both code and data evolve over time with inadequate (and sometimes non-existent) controls. Given the shortage and cost of ML talent and the increased demands for ML technology, there is a pressing need to automate and simplify these development and deployment processes.</p>\r\n",

      "<h2>Challenge 3: Safety</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As ML applications become more ubiquitous and increasingly influence societal interactions (e.g., curating news, determining credit worthiness, influencing criminal sentencing, navigating vehicles autonomously), the safety risks associated with the misuse or misunderstanding of this technology are magnified. It is, thus, critical to understand and audit the behavior of ML applications: do we understand how models are making their decisions? What is the confidence / uncertainty associated with individual decisions? Do these predictions pose immediate threats to an individual or to society? What are the broader ethical ramifications of a given ML application? What information is being used to make decisions? Is individual privacy adequately being preserved?</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Unfortunately, ML applications do not provide us with straightforward answers to these questions. They are inherently data-driven and not based on simple rules, and we have a fundamental lack of understanding as to why leading ML approaches (e.g., deep learning models) even work in the first place. In addition to advancing our basic scientific understanding, it is paramount that we develop robust ML-centric engineering processes to mitigate potential safety risks. These new processes must address the complexity and uncertainty inherent to ML applications.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>These challenges—efficiency, automation, and safety—won’t be solved overnight. It is clear that they touch a broad set of disciplines, and consequently devising effective solutions will require cooperation between researchers and engineers spanning both academia and industry.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"F4\">From an academic perspective, we are already witnessing encouraging signs of interdisciplinary progress, as these core challenges have spurred the development of new research communities. Two notable examples are: (i) the SysML<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> research community that works at the intersection of systems and ML to design system-aware algorithms and identify best practices for learning systems; and (ii) the FatML<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> research community that brings together a diverse set of social and quantitative researchers and practitioners concerned with fairness, accountability, and transparency in ML.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>However, we ultimately want to move beyond academic research, and leverage cutting-edge theoretical advances in order to design and build increasingly robust and sophisticated engineering systems. To do so will require coordination between researchers working on more abstract and theoretical problems and engineers who understand industrial processes and real-world deployment requirements. While we have a long way to go before we arrive at the Jet Age of ML, continued collaborative efforts will truly enable ML to take flight.</p>\r\n",

We’re finding overlap between the themes explored at these community events and recent articles written about Jupyter. That overlap, in turn, illustrates the kinds of dialog that we’re looking forward to at <a href=\"http://jupytercon.com/?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-jpny18_new_site_the-intertwingularity-is-near_body_text_link\">JupyterCon</a> this August.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In the news, notably there was the James Somers article, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/\">“The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete”</a>, in <em>The Atlantic</em>, and a subsequent piece, <a href=\"https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/\">“Jupyter, Mathematica, and the Future of the Research Paper”</a>, by Paul Romer, former chief economist at the World Bank. Both articles compare and contrast between Wolfram Research’s <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/\">Mathematica</a> and Project Jupyter. On the surface these two approaches both implement notebooks, with excellent examples coming from both communities. However, Paul Romer nailed the contrast between them with a one-liner: <em>“The tie-breaker is social, not technical. The more I learn about the open source community, the more I trust its members.”</em></p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Under the surface, the parallels end. Mathematica, which came first, is a popular commercial software product. Jupyter is an open standard for a suite of network protocols that support remote execution environments—plus a spectrum of open source software projects that build extensible environments atop, such as <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906\">JupyterLab</a>, <a href=\"https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">JupyterHub</a>, <a href=\"http://mybinder.readthedocs.io/\">Binder</a>, etc. Organizations leverage Jupyter as a foundation for shared data infrastructure at scale. Organizational challenges emerge along with those implementations at scale: collaboration, discovery, security, compliance, privacy, ethics, provenance, etc. Through this open, community-centered approach, we get open standards, open source implementations, and open discussions about best practices for shared concerns.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>For common threads between the two, James Somers’ distillation is subtle: “Software is a dynamic medium; paper isn’t.” It’s been 27 years since the public debut of the World Wide Web, though we’re still barely scratching the surface of what that invention made possible. Frankly, an overwhelming amount of “digital paper” persists on the web. While the promise of WWW implies dynamic, interactive media shared across global infrastructure, questions linger about how best to make it happen. Some of those questions have also been in the news recently.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Rolling the clock back a few decades further, one gem on my bookshelf is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines\"><em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</em></a>, by Ted Nelson, first published in 1974. Nelson explored hypertext, which he’d been working to implement since 1963—though, arguably, that notion traces back to Vannevar Bush and Jorge Luis Borges in the 1940s. To capture the essence of hypertext, <em>Computer Lib</em> also introduced the concept of \"intertwingularity\": complex interrelations within human knowledge. Nelson’s vision had documents representing the world’s knowledge, documents which could interact and intermingle. Borges prefigured a poetic glimpse of this in his 1941 short story, <a href=\"http://www.literatura.us/borges/jardin.html\"><em>El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan</em></a>: the legend of Ts’ui Pên constructing an infinite labyrinth, in which all would lose their way, along with a WWII espionage drama unfolding around that legend.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Out of the many neologisms and one-liners that have attempted to describe Jupyter, <em>intertwingularity</em> nails it. One may “perform science” by authoring a research paper in a journal. That’s science with a lowercase “s,” on paper or something approximating it—merey navigating a single corner of Ts’ui Pên’s labyrinth. Ted Nelson’s vision, however, had documents interacting, intermingling. The practice of reproducible science, which is rapidly unfolding around Jupyter, also relies on documents interacting and intermingling. That opens the door to software as a dynamic medium, \"Science\" with an uppercase “S.” Not merely a library of “digital paper,” but an entirely new way of collaborating, extending our understanding. Potentially as a map through the entire labyrinth.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Reproducible science via Jupyter finds immediate applications in many places. Certainly there are the “hard sciences”: at JupyterCon, we’ll have session talks ranging across astrophysics, quantum chemistry, genomics, geospatial analysis, climatology, and scientific computing in general. During the <a href=\"https://atl-jugheads.github.io/jupyter-day-atlanta-ii/\">Jupyter Day Atlanta</a> event, one excellent example was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scianalytics/status/980167093596323840\">“Classification and Characterization of Metal Powder in Additive Manufacturing using Convolutional Neural Networks,”</a> by Anna Smith from CMU.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Beyond research, reproducible science is vital for any organization that depends on analysis—and that forms Jupyter’s direct link to data science. During the <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/popup-ma/public/content/slides\">Jupyter Pop-up Boston</a> event, Dave Stuart presented <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glrBe2zwihc&amp;list=PL055Epbe6d5Zc0ZUWqaeW7haYzuLzmcAq&amp;index=11\">“Citizen Data Science campaign,”</a> about an open source project called <a href=\"https://github.com/nbgallery/\">nbgallery</a>, which thousands of DoD analysts use to discover and share Jupyter notebooks. While some teams have computational needs in common, they may not be allowed to share data. Similar data privacy concerns are encountered in finance, health care, social media, etc. The DoD project provides a fascinating approach to discovery (search, recommendations) for interactive content in highly regulated enterprise environments.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In Atlanta, two industry use cases addressed similar needs: Peter Parente from Valassis Digital with <a href=\"http://bit.ly/give-atl\">“Give a Little Bit of Your Notebooks to Me”</a>—also about sharing and discovering notebook content across an enterprise organization—and John Patanian from General Electric with “Achieving Reproducible and Deployable Data Science Workflows,” about using <a href=\"https://github.com/patanijo/iris_ml_model\">templates</a> for reproducible workflows.</p>\r\n",

In Boston, David Koop and Colin Brown from UMassD presented <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJcpzSVWfj0&amp;list=PL055Epbe6d5Zc0ZUWqaeW7haYzuLzmcAq&amp;index=10\">“Supporting Reproducibility in Jupyter through Dataflows.”</a> Also, see a related project called <a href=\"https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/07/26/nodebook/\">Nodebook</a> at Stitch Fix by Kevin Zielnicki. By default, cells in a Jupyter Notebook run from top to bottom—although, a person needs to “Run All” to be sure that results are correct. The Dataflows and Nodebook projects track inputs and outputs for each cell so that notebooks can be guaranteed to “rerun” successfully. The <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/68448\">UMassD project</a> also allows for rearranging cell order: for example, while you may need a long list of Python imports to initialize a notebook, why not move that cell to the end, so that the initial part of a notebook can jump directly into core code? On the one hand, that supports better scaffolding. On the other hand, these projects represent Jupyter Notebooks as dependency graphs, with pre- and post-conditions for each cell. That’s only a few steps away from Petri nets and other automata used for formal analysis of computer programs, concurrency, business process, reliability engineering, security audits, etc. An imaginable next step could be to leverage machine learning to start generating unit tests—and for <a href=\"https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/\">code gen</a> in general.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Here’s an intertwingled idea that weaves together most of the above. Generations of modern science have brought us to a point where reproducible science becomes a priority. Collaboration at a global scale can’t proceed further without it. Meanwhile, open source software, since roughly 1998, has similarly evolved to support collaboration at a global scale, leading to standard practices such as versioning (e.g., git), testing, documentation, pull requests, etc. Most of those practices support reusability. Adding some DevOps, continuous integration/continuous deployment is the software analogy for reproducible science.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>We’re at a point where those two cultures, science and open source, have much to learn from each other. Science must learn to reuse and improve common software tools, while software must embrace reproducible science. Both are necessary for collaboration at scale. The nexus for that intermingling is Jupyter, where (and when) humans move beyond using digital mimics of print media to take better advantage of what software and collaboration promise in the long term.</p>\r\n",

While developing patents and intellectual properties might not be what you’re setting out to do as part of your humanitarian efforts, the way we approach our jobs as inventors is something that can be applied across all aspects of giving back. Consider the United Nations’ <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>, which aim to eradicate things like poverty, hunger, disease, and more. These are game-changing initiatives that definitely require new ideas. What’s more, the United Nations estimates that we’re $5 trillion short on resources needed to accomplish these goals.

To do this, we look around us to see which relevant technologies we can use that are already at our disposal so we don’t have to completely reinvent the wheel if we don’t have to. We also identify which parts of the solution need a completely new idea to be created from scratch. Additionally, we look at the issue we’re trying to solve and the current landscape as a whole so we can predict any issues or future problems that may arise, and we try to address them ahead of time in our invention.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>These are a just a few ideas for how AI can be used for social good— there are still plenty of opportunities out there. The challenge is how to get started, so here are three best practices I’d like to share to help people who want to embark on this journey.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<ol>\r\n",
      "\t<li>First, build your understanding of what AI is and is not through great online learning, such as <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271\">Intro to Artificial Intelligence</a>, led by Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun, on Udacity.</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Second, think differently. AI is a different computing model. Instead of thinking about use cases and scenarios, really focus on the problem you want to solve. Think more “ideal scenario” on how to best develop a solution, and then see if a machine can be trained to do this work. Let’s consider personalized education, particularly reading comprehension (which has shown to have a tremendous impact on a child’s long-term educational performance across all subjects). With a traditional use case approach, we would probably try to develop a general framework that would help in a handful of scenarios. Now, <a href=\"http://www.united2read.org/learningovations/\">Learning Ovations</a> has thought about the more ideal scenario. They have realized there are too many possible scenarios to program or for a general framework to even cover. Instead, they’re training AI to assess each child’s performance (across traditional metrics and some new ones) as a tool for educators and parents. In addition, they’re creating an AI-powered recommendation engine based on each individual school’s curriculum to provide another tool for educators to create a customized reading program for each student. Thus, Learning Ovations thought differently on how to personalized education.</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Third, set aside preconceived notions. There are things that people are better than machines at doing, but there are things machines are better than people at doing—some of which may be surprising. For example, people seem to be more honest in sharing health or financial information with a machine than a person because they don’t worry about being judged. This typically means the machine gets more accurate data to provide recommendations. Thus, recognizing that a machine might be as capable in some areas could unlock whole new capabilities.</li>\r\n",

      "\r\n",

Technology will only continue to become more advanced, creating new opportunities to fix societal problems related to health, sustainability, conservation, accessibility, and much more. If you’re thinking of jumping into AI for good, just remember the most important rule: think differently.</p>\r\n",

That’s a fitting summary of Facebook’s Very Bad Month. There’s nothing here we haven’t seen before, nothing about abuse, trolling, racism, spam, porn, and even bots that hasn’t already happened. This time as farce? Certainly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-zuckerberg-15-year-apology-tour-hasnt-fixed-facebook/\">Zuckerberg’s 14-year Apology Tour</a>, as Zeynep Tufecki calls it, has the look and feel of a farce. He just can’t stop apologizing for Facebook’s messes.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Except that the farce isn’t over yet. We’re in the middle of it. As Tufekci points out, 2018 isn’t the first time Zuckerberg has said “we blew it, we’ll do better.” Apology has been a roughly biennial occurrence since Facebook’s earliest days. So, the question we face is simple: how do we bring this sad history to an endpoint that isn’t farce? The third time around, should there be one, it isn’t even farce; it’s just stupidity. We don’t have to accept future apologies, whether they come from Zuck or some other network magnate, as inevitable.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I want to think about what we can learn from the forerunners of modern social networks—specifically about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\">USENET</a>, the proto-internet of the 1980s and 90s. (The same observations probably apply to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\">BBSs</a>, though I’m less familiar with them.) USENET was a decentralized and unmanaged system that allowed Unix users to exchange “posts” by sending them to hundreds of newsgroups. It started in the early 80s, peaked sometime around 1995, and arguably ended as tragedy (though it went out with a whimper, not a bang).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As a no-holds-barred Wild West sort of social network, USENET was filled with everything we rightly complain about today. It was easy to troll and be abusive; all too many participants did it for fun. Most groups were eventually flooded by spam, long before spam became a problem for email. Much of that spam distributed pornography or pirated software (“warez”). You could certainly find newsgroups in which to express your inner neo-Nazi or white supremacist self. Fake news? We had that; we had malicious answers to technical questions that would get new users to trash their systems. And yes, there were bots; that technology isn’t as new as we’d like to think.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But there was a big divide on USENET between moderated and unmoderated newsgroups. Posts to moderated newsgroups had to be approved by a human moderator before they were pushed to the rest of the network. Moderated groups were much less prone to abuse. They weren’t immune, certainly, but moderated groups remained virtual places where discussion was mostly civilized, and where you could get questions answered. Unmoderated newsgroups were always spam-filled and frequently abusive, and the alt.* newsgroups, which could be created by anyone, for any reason, matched anything we have now for bad behavior.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So, the first thing we should learn from USENET is the importance of moderation. Fully human moderation at Facebook scale is impossible. With seven billion pieces of content shared per day, even a million moderators would have to scan seven thousand posts each: roughly 4 seconds per post. But we don’t need to rely on human moderation. After USENET’s decline, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/observed-behavior-and-perceived-value-of-authors-in-usenet-newsgroups-bridging-the-gap/\">research</a> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2IltDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=usenet+trolls+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JEiHPslBRm&amp;sig=gerJGs1tO0WvIt9zsOgeSPSH6Ys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiryMmo_bzaAhUlWN8KHRZkArsQ6AEIUjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=usenet%20trolls%20analysis&amp;f=false\">showed</a> that it was possible to classify users as newbies, helpers, leaders, trolls, or flamers, purely by their communications patterns—with only minimal help from the content. This could be the basis for automated moderation assistants that kick suspicious posts over to human moderators, who would then have the final word. Whether automated or human, moderators prevent many of the bad posts from being made in the first place. It’s no fun being a troll if you can’t get through to your victims.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Automated moderation can also do fact checking. The technology that won Jeopardy a decade ago is more than capable of checking basic facts. It might not be capable of checking complex logic, but most “fake news” centers around facts that can easily be evaluated. And automated systems are very capable of detecting bots: Google’s Gmail has successfully throttled spam.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What else can we learn from USENET? Trolls were everywhere, but the really obnoxious stuff stayed where it was supposed to be. I’m not naive enough to think that neo-Nazis and white supremacists will dry up and go away, on Facebook or elsewhere. And I’m even content to allow them to have their own Facebook pages: Facebook can let these people talk to each other all they want, because they’re going to do that anyway, whatever tools you put in place. The problem we have now is that Facebook’s engagement metric paves the road to their door. Once you give someone a hit of something titillating, they’ll come back for more. And the next hit has to be stronger. That’s how you keep people engaged, and that’s (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html\">as Tufekci has argued about YouTube</a>) how you radicalize them.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>USENET had no engagement metrics, no means of linking users to stronger content. Islands of hatred certainly existed. But in a network that didn’t optimize for engagement, hate groups didn’t spread. Neo-Nazis and their like were certainly there, but you had to search them out, you weren’t pushed to them. The platform didn’t lead you there, trying to maximize your “engagement.” I can’t claim that was some sort of brilliant design on USENET’s part; it just wasn’t something anyone thought about at the time. And as a free service, there was a need to maximize profit. Facebook’s obsession with engagement is ultimately more dangerous than their sloppy handling of personal data. “Engagement” allows—indeed, encourages—hate groups to metastasize.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Engagement metrics harm free speech, another ideal carried to the modern internet from the USENET world. But in an “attention economy,” where the limiting factor is attention, not speech, we have to rethink what those values mean. I’ve said that USENET ended in a “whimper”—but what drained the energy away? The participants who contributed real value just got tired of wading through the spam and fighting off the trolls. They went elsewhere. USENET’s history gives us a warning: good speech was crowded off the stage by bad speech.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Speech that exists to crowd out other speech isn’t the unfettered interchange of ideas. Free speech doesn’t mean the right to a platform. Indeed, the U.S. Constitution already makes that distinction: “freedom of the press” is about platforms, and you don’t get freedom of the press unless you have a press. Again, Zeynep Tufekci has it: in “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-issue-tech-turmoil-new-censorship/\">It’s the (Democracy-Poisoning) Golden Age of Free Speech</a>,” she writes “The most effective forms of censorship today involve meddling with trust and attention, not muzzling speech itself.” Censorship isn’t about arresting dissidents; it’s about generating so much noise that voices you don’t like can’t be heard.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If we’re to put an end to the farce, we need to understand what it means to enable speech, rather than to drown it out. Abandoning “engagement” is part of the solution. We will be better served by a network that, like USENET, doesn’t care how people engage, and that allows them to make their own connections. Automated moderation can be a tool that makes room for speech, particularly if we can take advantage of communication patterns to moderate those whose primary goal is to be the loudest voice.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Marx certainly would have laid blame at the feet of Zuckerberg, for naively and profitably commoditizing the social identities of his users. But blame is not a solution. As convenient a punching bag as Zuckerberg is, we have to recognize that Facebook’s problems extend to the entire social world. That includes Twitter and YouTube, many other social networks past and present, and many networks that are neither online nor social. Expecting Zuck to “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571\">fix Facebook</a>” may be the best way to guarantee that the farce plays on.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>History is only deterministic in hindsight, and it doesn’t have to end in farce (or worse). We all build our social networks, and Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only player on history’s stage. We need to revisit, reassess, and learn from all of our past social networks. Demanding and building a social network that serves us and enables free speech, rather than serving a business metric that amplifies noise, is the way to end the farce.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

We often speak of markets in the abstract, as addressable segments of the economy, defining them by examples of companies and by comparisons to others engaged in similar activities. Sales and marketing leaders have richer internal models of markets they use to guide their organizations as they fight for their share of the markets they contest. In January 2015, I set out to build an external representation of a market every bit as rich as those in the minds of leading executives driving successful companies; I founded an analytics startup called <a href=\"http://www.relato.io/\">Relato</a>—a startup that, unfortunately, did not succeed. In this post, I’ll present the story of the company and the work I did there, the entrepreneurship and network science involved in my work, and some insight into how <em>not to</em> run a young analytics startup, and a little about how to do so as well.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>My mission with Relato was to build a deeper understanding of the modern networked economy, a vast network in which companies are best defined according to their business relationships with other companies.

      "<p>I started Relato with an experiment to see how much market intelligence I could gather from the business web. Having worked at LinkedIn, I missed their social graph. I wondered, “Could a copy of the business graph be collected from the open web?” The answer to that research question is what led me to found Relato.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>I started by surveying the state of the market for data on companies. I discovered that while basic firmographic data was available—things like address, industry code, website technologies—there was nothing that captured the actual business activity of companies. By contrast, when I surveyed the websites of businesses, I found a treasure trove of information about their business relationships with other companies. Starting with a market I knew—big data—I manually transcribed the partnership pages of the major players: Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR, and Pivotal. The combined list came to hundreds of companies—not a bad survey of the big data market.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>I saw opportunity! I could transcribe the companies listed on partnership pages to learn how companies actually did business. Then I could use graph analytics on this data to extract next-generation profiles on companies. This data could be used in lead scoring and lead generation systems to provide a breakthrough in their level of performance. In short, I could provide leads for enterprise customers that would convert to sales at a rate never before seen! I got excited. What if sales calls only came to people who wanted your product, because Relato told you so? I could optimize the economy and change the world! I was inspired.</p>\r\n",

Using this method, there would ultimately be a higher cost per record collected because I would be paying real humans wages, but the up-front cost in development time was much lower. This way, I could get started much faster, shipping a beta product to customers using money from angel investors instead of venture capitalists.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>Most data scientists use application programing interfaces (APIs) like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to automate delegating data processing tasks to humans. Rather than using an API, I built a data collection web application that was used by people I actually got to know: “mechanical Turks” I hired on a website called UpWork. They would transcribe partnership pages and enter them into a database using an application that did things like autocomplete company names to ensure the data was clean and consistent. If the page had thousands of partnerships, I automated the collection process using utilities I developed to extract the names and domains of companies.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>The system worked beautifully, and the workers became good at their jobs. I would spot check their work, offering corrections. Instead, they often corrected me! There is truly a wealth of talent available from underemployed individuals in areas of the world with less opportunity than we enjoy in the Bay Area.

Then I added to the model the features I derived from the partnership graph. It worked! The accuracy of the model increased dramatically. I knew I was on to something when the model indicated that the partnership centrality, a graph metric, was by far the most important feature determining lead scoring accuracy. It was even more important than the 650-area code (Silicon Valley) for a company selling to technology startups! Relato was off to a good start, algorithmically at least.

      "<p>Relato built two things: a lead generation system for B2B sales, and MarketMaps, a business graph visualization tool. A lead scoring system is just a predictive model for inbound business contacts, scoring them by how likely they are to become customers. A lead generation system adds a database already populated with a “universe” full of contacts, plus a lot of plumbing to shuffle the data through the system, through the algorithms and back out to the customer. In goes a current customer list, out go recommended leads.</p>\r\n",

A lead becomes an MQL when an analysis of the lead’s behavior determines the lead is likely enough to buy that they merit attention from a real person. MQLs for enterprise companies go for about $50 a piece. Marketo and other marketing automation systems calculate a lead score based on a lead’s behavior, such as when they interact with your website (10 points!) or download a white paper (50 points!). When the score becomes high enough, contact is made by a lead qualifier. A lead qualifier is a junior salesperson who makes initial sales contacts by phone and email. The problem with marketing automation systems is that the scoring algorithm is usually arbitrary. As a result, there is widespread dissatisfaction in the results generated by the large investments enterprises have made in marketing automation over the last decade. This is what drives the lead scoring market.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>In the first scenario, meet Harlow. Today is Harlow's first day on a new project. The team has a well-established codebase, a great working environment, and a robust test suite. As Harlow sits down at her desk, she's excited to get up to speed with the team. After the morning stand-up meeting she's pointed to the project's documentation for installation with a slight grimace from her colleague Riley. He mentions that the docs \"might be a little out of date, but should hopefully be enough to get you going.\" Harlow then spends the rest of the day following the documentation until she gets stuck, at which point she is forced to dig through code or ask colleagues for guidance. What might have taken a few minutes becomes a day-long exercise in frustration, tampering Harlow's initial excitement.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In the second scenario, meet Harrison. He's working on a web app and finds a library that, at first glance, seems incredibly useful for his project. As he attempts to integrate it with his codebase he discovers that parts of the API seem to be glossed over in the documentation or even undocumented. In the end, he walks away from the project in favor of another solution.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Though these scenarios may be slightly exaggerated, I'm reasonably certain that many of us can relate. These problems were not primarily caused by low-quality code, but rather by poor documentation.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>If useful documentation is so important to the success of projects and developer well-being, why don't all projects have it? The answer, I believe, is that like good code, good documentation is difficult and time consuming to write.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In my eyes, there are eight rules that we can follow to produce good documentation:</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<ol>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Write documentation that is inviting and clear</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Write documentation that is comprehensive, detailing all aspects of the project</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Write documentation that is skimmable</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Write documentation that offers examples of how to use the software</li>\r\n",

      "\t<li>Write documentation that is up-to-date</li>\r\n",

      "</ol>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The most important rule of good documentation is for it to <em>be as inviting as possible</em>. This means that we should aim to write it in the clearest terms possible without skipping over any steps. We should avoid making assumptions about what our users may know. Sometimes this can seem to be overkill, and we may be tempted to say something like \"every X developer knows about Y,\" but we each bring our own background and set of experiences to a project. Though this may result in more verbose documentation, it is ultimately simpler, as there is less guesswork involved for developers with all levels of experience.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Documentation should aim to <em>be comprehensive</em>. This means that all aspects of the project are documented. Undocumented features or exceptions can lead to frustration and become a time suck as users and other developers are forced to read through code to find the answers they need. Fully documenting all features takes away this kind of ambiguity.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>When we write documentation that is <em>skimmable</em>, we help users find the content they need quickly. Making documentation skimmable can be accomplished by using clear headings, bulleted lists, and links. For large project documentation, a table of contents or clear navigation will help users to skip straight to what they need, rather than scrolling through a single long document.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Documentation that features <em>examples</em> allows users to see how they might use the code themselves. Aim to provide examples of the most common use cases for the project, while letting the comprehensive documentation detail every possibility.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>It is perfectly acceptable to <em>include some repetition</em> in  documentation, which the <a href=\"http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/#arid\">Write the Docs project</a> terms \"ARID\" (accepts (some) repetition in documentation). Doing so acknowledges that users may not read the full docs or that some information is relevant in multiple places in the documentation. While good code may be DRY, good writing aims to be clear, and sometimes this means repeating ourselves. The Write the Docs project calls out the difference between writing that is ARID, DRY, and WET in this way:</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Effective documentation is <em>kept up-to-date</em>. This is surprisingly challenging. We may begin our project with the best of intentions and great documentation, but as our software evolves and we are quickly iterating, it can be easy to fall out of step. If you are working as part of an agile development team, I recommend adding documentation to your team's \"definition of done.\" For independent projects, try to treat documentation as an important final step.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Documentation that is <em>easy to contribute to</em> is also easy to keep up-to-date. The simplest way to make documentation easy to contribute to is to treat it as code, storing it as text in source control. The site and book <a href=\"http://docslikecode.com/about/\">Docs Like Code</a> advocates for treating our docs like our code by using source control, automating builds, and applying software development tools and techniques to our documentation practices.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Documentation is only as helpful as it is <em>easy to find</em>. Keeping an updated README file and linking to more extensive documentation at the top of the README when necessary helps to keep discoverability simple.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>I hope these guidelines are useful as you draft your project's documentation.

      "\r\n",
      "<p>Here are some highlights:</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>The rise of malicious bots</h2>\r\n",
      "<blockquote>\r\n",
      "<p>One of the factors driving the current proliferation of malicious bots is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)\">Mirai malware</a>. It works by using a list of default usernames and passwords (from previous data breaches) to take control of IoT devices. One key differentiator with Mirai is that it’s self-propagating—each infected device has the ability to scan the internet to find similar devices and subsequently infect them. This has also spurred other self-propagating, copycat malware.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Another key factor driving malicious bot growth is the increase in malware that focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities (versus relying on usernames and passwords). The malware automates the process of scanning and infecting IoT devices for known vulnerabilities. Then, they're exploiting those known software vulnerabilities, which are quite common in IoT devices. The volume of attack traffic these devices can generate is a huge differentiator because many of these devices have access to pretty sizeable CPUs, and they've got access to a lot of bandwidth. As a result, we're seeing DDoS attacks being launched by these botnets in excess of 1.5 terabits per second. That's enough traffic to take a small country offline.</p>\r\n",
      "</blockquote>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>Mitigating malicious bot threats</h2>\r\n",
      "<blockquote>\r\n",
      "<p>To manage the risks malicious bots pose, organizations need to be aware that, realistically, bots represent a significant portion of site and application traffic. They must understand the threats against their specific business models and recognize the need to build systems that can differentiate between good bot traffic, bad bot traffic, and human activity. Sites and applications must allow good bots to continue performing critical activities (scrape data for Google search queries, for example), but also mitigate malicious bot activity. Done poorly, you could reduce the effectiveness of your SEO, or worse yet, block paying customers from your sites or applications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>An effective DDoS incident response plan includes detection and mitigation of these bot-driven attacks. Defenses should be layered, including cloud-based defenses for volumetric attacks, and most likely web application firewalls for the more measured attacks. Without having a DDoS response plan in place, you’re a sitting duck and effectively just waiting for one of these attacks to take your organization offline.</p>\r\n",
      "</blockquote>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>Preparing for the malicious bot attacks of the future</h2>\r\n",
      "<blockquote><p>The malicious bot threat landscape will continue to evolve rapidly. To prepare, organizations must embrace advanced data capabilities, such as AI and supervised machine learning, to detect and defeat sophisticated malicious bot attacks. Additionally, businesses need to focus on hiring security intelligence analysts. Embracing AI and machine learning is only helpful if we have the capabilities to analyze the output. Accordingly, security analyst skills will be in very high demand.</p></blockquote>\r\n",

      "\t<li>Moss says AI techniques are “a new set of weapons” against perpetrators of financial crime. “If we use them right, we can finally at least slow down the constant tide of financial crime.”</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>AI can be more effective than traditional methods of combatting identity fraud, health care fraud, and money laundering, because for those issues, he explains, “you’re not looking for a needle in a haystack. You’re looking for a needle in a stack of needles. You are trying to find individuals whose nefarious activity is disguised and hidden in pure normality, by completely innocuous activity.”</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Moss compares the use of machine learning techniques to a rules engine: “a rules engine looks for behaviors that have already happened, whereas machine learning is trying to connect different bread crumbs. It’s running multiple scenarios at the same time to try to look at the problem from multiple different angles.”</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Machine learning can add efficiency to the detection process: “It can take multiple data sources, map the data to a case, analyze it, and then in seconds, make a decision on whether it’s a false positive, whether it’s normal business activity, whether it’s something that needs further investigation, or whether it is outright criminality,” Moss says.</li>\r\n",

Project Jupyter, NumFOCUS, and O'Reilly Media will present the second annual JupyterCon in New York City August 21–25, 2018.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Timing for this event couldn't be better. The human side of data science, machine learning/AI, and scientific computing is more important than ever. This is seen in the broad adoption of data-driven decision-making in human organizations of all kinds, the increasing importance of human centered design in tools for working with data, the urgency for better data insights in the face of complex socioeconomic conditions worldwide, as well as dialogue about the social issues these technologies bring to the fore: collaboration, security, ethics, data privacy, transparency, propaganda, etc.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>To paraphrase our co-chairs, Brian Granger:</p>\r\n",
      "<blockquote><p>Jupyter is where humans and data science intersect.</p></blockquote>\r\n",
      "<p>And Fernando Perez:</p>\r\n",
      "<blockquote><p>The better the technology, the more important that human judgement becomes.</p></blockquote>\r\n",
      "<p>Consequently, we'll explore three main themes at JupyterCon 2018:</p>\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "<li>\r\n",
      "<strong>Interactive computing with data at scale:</strong> the technical best practices and organizational challenges of supporting interactive computing in companies, universities, research collaborations, etc., (JupyterHub)</li>\r\n",
      "<li>\r\n",
      "<strong>Extensible user interfaces</strong> for data science, machine learning/AI, and scientific computing (JupyterLab)</li>\r\n",
      "<li>\r\n",
      "<strong>Computational communication:</strong> taking the artifacts of interactive computing and communicating them to different audiences</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "<p>A meta-theme that ties these together is extensible software architecture for interactive computing with data. Jupyter is built on a set of flexible, extensible, and re-usable building blocks that can be combined and assembled to address a wide range of usage cases. These building blocks are expressed through the various open protocols, APIs, and standards of Jupyter.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>The Jupyter community has much to discuss and share this year. For example, success stories such as the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xuNj5paMuow?t=12m17s\">data science program at UC Berkeley</a> illustrate the power of <a href=\"https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">JupyterHub</a> deployments at scale in education, research, and industry. As universities and enterprise firms learn to handle the technical challenges of rolling out hands-on, interactive computing at scale, a cohort of organizational challenges come to the fore: practices regarding collaboration, security, compliance, data privacy, ethics, etc. These points are especially poignant in verticals such as health care, finance, and education, where the handling of sensitive data is rightly constrained by ethical and legal requirements (HIPAA, FERPA, etc.). Overall, this dialogue is extremely relevant—it is happening at the intersection of contemporary political and social issues, industry concerns, new laws (GDPR), the evolution of computation, plus good storytelling and communication in general—as we'll explore with practitioners throughout the conference.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>The recent <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906\">beta release of JupyterLab</a> embodies the meta-theme of extensible software architecture for interactive computing with data. While many people think of Jupyter as a \"notebook,\" that's merely one building block needed for interactive computing with data. Other building blocks include terminals, file browsers, LaTeX, markdown, rich outputs, text editors, and renderers/viewers for different data formats. JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter, and provides these different building blocks in a flexible, configurable, customizable environment. This opens the door for Jupyter users to build custom workflows, and also for organizations to extend JupyterLab with their own custom functionality.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Thousands of organizations require data infrastructure for reporting, sharing data insights, reproducing results of analytics, etc. Recent <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-state-of-ai-adoption\">business studies</a>estimate that more than half of all companies globally are precluded from adopting AI technologies due to a lack of digital infrastructure— often because their efforts toward data and reporting infrastructure are buried in technical debt. So much of that infrastructure was built from scratch, even when organizations needed essentially the same building blocks. JupyterLab's primary goal is to make it <em>routine</em> to build highly customized, interactive computing platforms, while supporting more than 90 different popular programming environments.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-67XiM\"><img alt=\"JupyterLab\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/JupyterConFigure1-f38a7cba048cb78c03a5be1cd4a39825.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Screenshot from the <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906\">JupyterLab</a> beta release.

      "\r\n",
      "<p>A third major theme builds on top of the other two: computational communication. For data and code to be useful for humans, who need to make decisions, it has to be embedded into a narrative—a story— that that can be communicated to others. Examples of this pattern include: data journalism, reproducible research and open science, computational narratives, open data in society and government, citizen science, and really any area of scientific research (physics, zoology, chemistry, astronomy, etc.), plus the range of economics, finance, and econometric forecasting.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Another growing segment of use cases involves Jupyter as a \"last-mile\" layer for leveraging AI resources in the cloud. This becomes especially important in light of new hardware emerging for AI needs, vying with competing demand from online gaming, virtual reality, cryptocurrency mining, etc.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Please take the following as personal opinion, observations, perspectives: we've reached a point where hardware appears to be evolving more rapidly than software, while software appears to be evolving more rapidly than effective process. At O'Reilly Media, we work to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/s3ha6vHapcI\">map the emerging themes</a> in industry, in a process nicknamed \"radar.\" This perspective about hardware is a theme I've been mapping, and meanwhile comparing notes with industry experts. A few data points to consider: Jeff Dean's talk at NIPS 2017, \"<a href=\"http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/slides/dean-nips17.pdf\">Machine Learning for Systems and Systems for Machine Learning</a>\" about comparisons of CPUs/GPUs/TPUs, and how AI is transforming the design of computer hardware; <a href=\"https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208/\"><em>The Case for Learned Index Structures</em></a>, also from Google, about the impact of \"branch vs. multiple\" costs on decades of database theory; this podcast interview \"<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/scaling-machine-learning\">Scaling machine learning</a>\" with Reza Zadeh about the critical importance of hardware/software interfaces in AI apps; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7y9l-L8yiU\">video interview</a> that Wes McKinney and I recorded at JupyterCon 2017 about how <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/\">Apache Arrow</a> presents a much different take on how to leverage hardware and distributed resources.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>The notion that \"hardware &gt; software &gt; process\" contradicts the past 15–20 years of software engineering practice. It's an inversion of the general assumptions we make. In response, industry will need to rework approaches for building software within the context of AI— which was articulated succinctly by Lenny Pruss from Amplify Partners in \"<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/28/infrastructure-3-0-building-blocks-for-the-ai-revolution/\">Infrastructure 3.0: Building blocks for the AI revolution</a>.\" In this light, Jupyter provides an abstraction layer— a kind of buffer to help \"future proof\"— for complex use cases in NLP, machine learning, and related work. We're seeing this from most of the public cloud vendors, who are also leaders in AI, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, etc., and who will be represented at the conference in August.</p>\r\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/presentations?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-jpny18_new_site_jupyter-is-where-humans-and-data-science-intersect_body_text_link\">Our program at JupyterCon</a> will feature expert speakers across all of these themes. However, to me, that's merely the tip of the iceberg. So much of the real value that I get from conferences happens in the proverbial \"Hallway Track,\" where you run into people who are riffing off news they've just learned in a session— perhaps in line with your thinking, perhaps in a completely different direction. Those conversations have space to flourish when people get immersed in the community, the issues, the possibilities.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>It'll be a busy week. We'll have two days of training courses: intensive, hands-on coding, a lot of interaction with expert instructors. Training will overlap with one day of tutorials: led by experts, generally larger than training courses (though more detailed than session talks), featuring a lot of Q&amp;A.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Then we'll have two days of keynotes and session talks, expo hall, lunches and sponsored breaks, plus Project Jupyter sponsored events. Events include Jupyter User Testing, author signings, \"Meet the Experts\" office hours, demos in the vendor expo hall— plus related meetups in the evenings. Last year, the Poster Session was one of the biggest surprises to me: it was such a hit that it was difficult to move through the room; walkways were packed with people asking presenters questions about their projects.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>This year, we'll introduce a Business Summit, similar to the popular summits at the <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata\">Strata Data Conferences</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/\">The AI Conference</a>. This will include high-level presentations on the most promising and important developments in Jupyter for executives and decision-makers. Brian Granger and I will be hosting the Business Summit, along with Joel Horwitz of IBM. One interesting data point: among the regional events, we've seen much more engagement this year from enterprise and government than we'd expected, more emphasis on business use cases and new product launches. The ecosystem is growing, and will be represented well at JupyterCon!</p>\r\n",
      "<p>We will also feature an Education Track in the main conference, expanding on the well-attended Education Birds-of-a-Feather and related talks during JupyterCon 2017. Use of Jupyter in education has grown rapidly across many contexts: middle/high-school, universities, corporate training, and online courses. Lorena Barba and Robert Talbert will be organizing this track.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Following our schedule of conference talks, the week wraps up with a community sprint day on Saturday. You can work side-by-side with leaders and contributors in the Jupyter ecosystem to implement that feature you've always wanted, fix bugs, work on design, write documentation, test software, or dive deep into the internals of something in the Jupyter ecosystem. Be sure to bring your laptop.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Note that we believe true innovation depends on hearing from, and listening to, people with a variety of perspectives. Please read our <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/diversity/\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/diversity/\">Diversity Statement</a> for more details. Also, we're committed to creating a safe and productive environment for everyone at all of our events. Please read our <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/content/conduct\">Code of Conduct</a>. Last year, we were able to work with the community plus matching donations to provide several \"Diversity &amp; Inclusion\" scholarships, as well as more than dozen student scholarships. We're looking forward to building on that this year!</p>\r\n",
      "<p>That's a sample of what's coming up for JupyterCon in NYC this August. In preparation for the event, we'll also help present and sponsor a regional community event—check out <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jupyter-pop-up-dc-tickets-44090939186\">Jupyter Pop-up DC, May 15, 2018</a>. We look forward to many opportunities to showcase new work and ideas, to meet each other, to learn about the architecture of the project itself, and to contribute to the future of Jupyter.</p>\r\n",

Several biotechnology companies now specialize in identifying new drug-disease pairs by interrogating massive biomedical datasets with ever-evolving artificial intelligence algorithms. This systematic approach to repurposing, augmenting the chance application of drugs to new diseases, represents a powerful tool for producing new medicines. Indeed, major drug companies such as GlaxoSmithKline have committed to probing “<a href=\"https://resources.sharevault.com/ai-in-drug-discovery-and-development\">dark data</a>,” or failed trial data, to achieve this goal.</p>\r\n",

Promising candidates are selected for Phase II trials, which determine the effectiveness of the compound at treating a particular disease or indication in a small sample group.

      "<p>Just like their software engineering counterparts, data scientists will have to interact with the business side. This includes understanding the domain enough to make insights. Data scientists are often tasked with analyzing data to help the business, and this requires a level of business acumen. Finally, their results need to be given to the business in an understandable fashion. This requires the ability verbally and visually communicate complex results and observations in a way that the business can understand and act on them.</p>\n",
      "<p>My one sentence definition of a data scientist is: a data scientist is someone who has augmented their math and statistics background with programming to analyze data and create applied mathematical models.</p>\n",
      "<p>A common data scientist trait is that they’ve picked up programming <strong>out of necessity</strong> to accomplish what they couldn’t do otherwise. When I talk to data scientists, this is a common thing they tell me. In order to accomplish a more complicated analysis or because of an otherwise insurmountable problem, they learned how to program. Their programming and system creation skills aren’t the levels that you’d see from a programmer or data engineer—<strong>nor should they be</strong>.</p>\n",

Though some data science technologies really require a DevOps or DataOps set up, the majority of technologies don't.

      "<p>There is an overlap between a data scientist and a data engineer. However, the overlap happens at the ragged edges of each one’s abilities.</p>\n",
      "<p>For example, they overlap on analysis. However, a data scientist’s analytics skills will be far more advanced than a data engineer’s analytics skills. A data engineer can do some basic to intermediate level analytics, but will be hard pressed to do the advanced analytics that a data scientist does.</p>\n",
      "<p>Both a data scientist and a data engineer overlap on programming. However, a data engineer’s programming skills are well beyond a data scientist’s programming skills. Having a data scientist create a data pipeline is at the far edge of their skills, but is the bread and butter of a data engineer. In this way, the two roles are complementary, with data engineers supporting the work of data scientists.</p>\n",
      "<p>You’ll notice that there is another overlap between a data scientist and a data engineer—that of big data. Understanding each positions’ skills better, you can now understand the overlap. Data engineers use their programming and systems creation skills to create big data pipelines. Data scientists use their more limited programming skills and apply their advanced math skills to create advanced data products <strong>using those existing data pipelines</strong>. This difference between creating and using lies at the core of a team's failure or underperforming with big data. A team that expects their data scientists to create the data pipelines will be woefully disappointed.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>It’s unfortunately common for organizations to misunderstand the core skills and roles of each position. Some organizations believe that a data scientist can create data pipelines. A data scientist can create a data pipeline after a fashion. The issues with a data scientist creating a data pipeline are several fold. Remember that a data scientist has only learned programming and big data out of necessity. They’re smart people and can figure things out—eventually. Creating a data pipeline isn’t remotely their core competency.</p>\n",
      "<p>From the managerial point of view, the data science team will appear stuck. You’ll look around or hear about other teams and compare their progress to your team’s progress. It will appear as if the data science team isn’t performing or greatly under performing. This is an unfair evaluation based on misunderstanding the core competency of a data scientist.</p>\n",

      "<h3>Data scientists doing data engineering</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I’ve seen companies task their data scientists with things you’d have a data engineer do. The data scientists were running at 20-30% efficiency. The data scientist doesn’t know things that a data engineer knows off the top of their head. Creating a data pipeline isn’t an easy task—it takes advanced programming skills, big data framework understanding, and systems creation. These aren’t skills that an average data scientist has. A data scientist can acquire these skills; however, the return on investment (ROI) on this time spent will rarely pay off. Don’t misunderstand me: a data scientist does need programming and big data skills, just not at the levels that a data engineer needs them.</p>\n",
      "<p>There is also the issue of data scientists being relative amateurs in this data pipeline creation. A data scientist will make mistakes and wrong choices that a data engineer would (should) not. A data scientist often doesn’t know or understand the right tool for a job. Everything will get collapsed to using a single tool (usually the wrong one) for every task. The reality is that many different tools are needed for different jobs. A qualified data engineer will know these, and data scientists will often not know them.</p>\n",
      "<p>A recent example of this was a data scientist using Apache Spark to process a data set in the 10s of GB. Yes, Spark can process that amount of data. However, a small data program would have been much, much faster and better. Their Spark job was taking 10-15 minutes to execute, but the small data RDBMS took 0.01 seconds to accomplish the same thing. In this case, the data scientist solved the problem after a fashion, but didn’t understand what the right tool for the job was. Times that 15 minutes spent running that job by 16 times in a day (that’s on the low end for analysis), and your data scientist is spending four hours a day waiting because they’re using the wrong tool for the job.</p>\n",
      "<p>At another organization, their data scientists didn’t have any data engineering resources. The data scientists would work on the problems until they got stuck on a data engineering problem they couldn’t solve. They’d report back to the business that they couldn’t finish things and there it sat, half-finished. This led to the data scientists wasting their time up to that point, and left, by their estimate, millions of dollars on the table because things couldn’t be finished.</p>\n",
      "<p>A more worrisome manifestation of having a data scientist do a data engineer’s work is that the data scientist will get frustrated and quit. I’ve talked to many data scientists at various organizations who were doing data engineer work. The conversation is always the same—the data scientist complains that they came to the company to data science work, not data engineering work. They’ll do data engineering work in a pinch to get something done, but having a data scientist do data engineer work will drive them crazy. They will quit and you will have 3-6 months to get your data engineering act together.

      "<p>Having more data scientists than data engineers is generally an issue. It typically means that an organization is having their data scientists do data engineering. As I’ve shown, this leads to all sorts of problems.</p>\n",

For some organizations with more complex data engineering requirements, this can be 4-5 data engineers per data scientist.

The issue is that they’d rather write a paper on a problem than get something into production. Other times, their programming abilities only extend to creating something in R. Putting something written in R into production is an issue unto itself. They don’t think in terms of creating systems, like an engineer.</p>\n",
      "<p>The general issue with data scientists is that they’re not engineers who put things into production, create data pipelines, and expose those AI/ML results.</p>\n",

      "<p>As you looked at Figure 2, you probably wondered what happens to the gap between data science and data engineering. This exactly where the machine learning engineer fits in, as shown in Figure 3. They’re the conduit between the data pipeline a data engineer creates and what the data scientist creates. A machine learning engineer is responsible for taking what a data scientist finds or creates and making it production worthy (it’s worth noting that most of what a data scientist creates isn’t production worthy and is mostly hacked together enough to work).</p>\n",
      "<p>The machine learning engineer’s job primarily is to create the last mile of the data science pipeline. This might entail several parts. It might be rewriting a data scientist’s code from R/Python to Java/Scala. It might be optimizing the ML/AI code from a software engineering point of view that the data scientist wrote so it runs well (or runs at all). The machine learning engineer has the engineering background to enforce the necessary engineering discipline on a field (data science) that isn’t known for its adherence to good engineering principles.</p>\n",
      "<p>A model running in production requires care and feeding that software doesn’t. A machine learning model can go stale and start giving out incorrect or distorted results.

      "<p>To explain what I mean by slow moving, I will share the experience of those who I’ve seen make the transition from data engineer to machine learning engineer. They’ve spent years doing development work as a software engineer and then data engineer. They’ve always had an interest in statistics or math. Other times, they just got bored with the constraints of being a data engineer. Either way, this transition took years. I’m not seeing people become machine learning engineers after taking a beginning stats class or after taking a beginning machine learning course.</p>\n",

An engineer loves trues and falses, the black and white, and the ones and zeros of the the world. They don’t like uncertainty.

Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/automl/\">AutoML</a> is one such trend where it will find the best algorithm for you automatically and give results without requiring the work of a full-fledged data scientist. <a href=\"https://www.datarobot.com/\">DataRobot</a> is another technology that is automating the process of finding the right data science algorithm for the data. It will also aid the machine learning engineers in putting that algorithm into production.</p>\n",
      "<p>These tools aren’t going to replace hardcore data science, but it will allow data scientists to focus on the more difficult parts of data science. It will allow machine learning engineers to become more and more productive. We’ll see a gradually increasing amount of offloading to machine learning engineers and automation of algorithms.</p>\n",
      "<p>I’m torn on what level of productivity we should expect from machine learning engineers in the future. To grossly oversimplify things, will machine learning engineers be the Wordpress configurators to their web developer counterparts? In this scenario, a machine learning engineer can be productive with very known and standard use cases, and only a data scientist can handle the really custom work. Or will machine learning engineers be the database administrator reborn? Given an in-depth knowledge of the model, they can use a known, cookie-cutter approach to configure a model, get correct results 50-80% of the time, and that’s good enough for what was needed. To get truly accurate results, you would need a data scientist.</p>\n",

This is a change I’ve helped other organizations accomplish, and they’ve seen tremendous results. In cases where the data science group seemed stuck and unable to perform, we created data engineering teams, showed the data science and data engineering teams how to work together, and put the right processes in place. </p>\n",

      "<h2>1. There’s an AI skills gap</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Of particular note is an AI skills gap revealed in the survey. 28% of respondents are using deep learning now and 54% say it will play a key role in their future projects. Who will do this work? AI talent is scarce, and the increase in AI projects means the talent pool will likely get smaller in the near future.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>2. Companies are addressing the AI skills gap through training</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Deep learning remains a relatively new technique, one that hasn’t been part of the typical suite of algorithms employed by industrial data scientists. So, it’s no surprise that the main factor holding companies back from trying deep learning is the skills gap. To overcome this gap, a majority (75%) of respondents said their company is using some form of in-house or external training program. Almost half (49%) of respondents said their company offered “in-house on-the-job training.” 35% indicated their company used either formal training from a third party or from individual training consultants or contractors.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>The rise of deep learning can be traced to its success in computer vision, speech technologies, and game playing, but our survey shows developers and data scientists are more likely to use it to work with structured or semistructured data. Why? There are good reasons. Upgrading familiar applications with deep learning is a safer investment than starting something new, businesses have a lot of structured and semistructured data already, and the number of businesses that can currently make use of computer vision (to say nothing of gaming) is limited. That said, our respondents see value in vision technology, and new deep learning applications for vision will grow in tandem with text and semistructured data.</p>\r\n",

Assuming your assumptions are accurate, you get carried away and spend way too much time on something before gathering feedback. But honestly, when would you rather hear all of your effort was a waste: after you spent a day working on it, or after working on it for a week?</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>A feedback loop is straightforward: it uses its input as one of its inputs. In its simplest form, a developer changes a code base and then gets feedback from the system by unit testing. This feedback will now be input for the developer’s next steps to improve the code. However, reality is not that simple. Plus, humans have an irrepressible tendency to include as many people as possible in one loop.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>If you follow such a course, you’ll end up with feedback chaos: massive “loops” including every potential player make it impossible to control, validate assumptions, and create a shared sense of reality. Quite simply, there’s too much going on. But there’s a solution: reflection. Reflection helps you identify existing feedback loops and determine who needs to be included. The shorter the feedback loop, the better.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>There are two forms of feedback: personal and tool based. Personal feedback is given on an interpersonal level—people discussing code, products, or processes and identifying where things can be improved. Tool-based feedback, such as static analysis, provides you with code-level feedback and tells you where to improve your code (or specific parts of your code) to increase quality. Personal feedback is often specific for projects, more sensitive to context, and offers concrete suggestions to implement. Tool-based feedback enables faster feedback loops, allows for scalability by iteration, and is more objective. But which form of feedback is better?</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>There is a false dichotomy between full automation and human intervention. Successful quality control combines tool-based measurement with manual review and discussion.

There are many challenges that need to be addressed to create the right architecture to support the range of fast data applications that your enterprise needs.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Here are five considerations every software architect and developer needs to take into account when setting the architectural foundations for a fast data platform.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>1. Determine requirements first</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Although this seems the obvious starting point of every software architecture, there are specific considerations to observe when we define the set of requirements for a software platform to support fast data applications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Data in motion can be tricky to characterize, as there are usually probabilistic factors involved in the generation, transmission, collection, and processing of messages.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>These are some of the questions we need answered in order to help us drive the architecture:</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h3>General data shape</h3>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "\t<li>How large is each message?</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>How many messages per time unit do we expect?</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Do we expect large changes in the frequency of message delivery? Are there peak hours? Are there “Black Friday” events in our business?</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h3>Output expectations</h3>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "\t<li>How fast do we need a result?</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Do we need to process each record individually? Or can we process them in small collections (micro-batch)</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h3>Process tolerance</h3>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "\t<li>How “dirty” is the data? What do we do with “dirty” data? Drop it? Report it? Clean and reprocess it?</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Do I need to preserve ordering? Are there inherent time relationships in the messages that need to be preserved as they travel across the system?</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>What message process warranty level do we require? At least once? At most once? Exactly once?</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The data shape will dictate capacity planning, tuning of the backbone, and scalability analysis for individual components.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The output expectations will assist in the choice of processing engine while the process tolerance will add restrictions in terms of processing semantics and error handling.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>2. Leverage the convergence of fast data and microservices</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Fast data applications are, by nature, focused on a single task. They have a clear input and output definition, and often a schema as well. Wait. Are we describing fast data applications or microservices? There is a blurred line dividing the two, and data processing libraries such as <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.5/scala/stream/index.html\">Akka Streams</a> and <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/\">Kafka Streams</a> make that line blur even more, as we can use these libraries to embed data processing capabilities in our microservices.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>We can think of combinations of data-processing applications with microservices to deliver specific features and insights from a data stream. For example, we can combine a machine learning job for anomaly detection with a dashboard that summarizes the findings to facilitate further investigation.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>From a project perspective, creating small, self-contained, data-driven applications that meld streaming data and microservices together is a good practice to break down large problems and projects into approachable chunks, reduce risk, and deliver value faster.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>3. Get the message across</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>We discussed how fast data applications and microservices converge on the conceptual and executional levels. Another element they have in common is that they are both consuming and producing messages. A message-oriented implementation requires an efficient messaging backbone that facilitates the exchange of data in a reliable and secure way with the lowest latency possible.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Apache Kafka</a> is currently the leading project in this area. It delivers a publish/subscribe model backed by a distributed log implementation that provides durability, resilience, fault tolerance, and the ability to replay messages by different consumers. The multi-subscriber approach creates the opportunity to reuse a single data stream for multiple consuming applications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>4. Leverage your SQL knowledge</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>We usually relate SQL to querying tables in relational databases. At first, it might seem odd to issue an SQL query on a stream of data. But what is a table? It’s a collection of records that were added, updated or deleted over time. We can see a table as an consolidated view of a stream of events over time. Likewise, we can create a stream from the observable changes applied to a table, reported as events. As Tyler Akiadu, from Google, explained in his Strata NY 2017 presentation, “<a href=\"https://s.apache.org/streaming-sql-strata-nyc\">Foundations of streaming SQL</a>”: “Streams are the in-motion form of data, both bounded and unbounded.” He goes further to explain how the relational algebra behind SQL can be applied to streams of data when we add time into the algebra in what he calls “time-varying relations.”</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In 2016, Apache Spark <a href=\"https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/28/structured-streaming-in-apache-spark.html\">introduced Structured Streaming</a>, a new streaming engine based on the SparkSQL abstractions and runtime optimizations. In the same year, Apache Flink <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/news/2016/05/24/stream-sql.html\">announced streaming SQL support</a>. More recently, Apache Kafka also <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksql-open-source-streaming-sql-for-apache-kafka/\">introduced the KSQL query engine</a>, adding streaming query capabilities to the popular event back end.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The adoption of fast data technologies is on a steep rise. The low-level streaming implementations of the mentioned engines require specialized knowledge in order to program new applications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "<h2>5. Build on the shoulders of giants</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As we mentioned at the beginning, we expect fast data applications to work reliably, continuously, and deliver results almost in near real time. These requirements impose strong scalability and resilience implications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Developing standalone applications that fulfill those requirements would be prohibitively expensive, as it would require specialized knowledge of distributed systems, operating systems, and networks, requiring large development and testing efforts to cover the complexity that distributed applications present. Instead, we build those applications on data-oriented frameworks, like <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\">Apache Spark</a> and <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\">Apache Flink</a>, or we resort to libraries that we can embed in our services, such as <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/\">Kafka Streams</a> and <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.5/scala/stream/index.html\">Akka Streams</a>. These data-oriented stacks implement the low-level complexity and take care of the resilience of the application execution. In turn, they offer a high-level abstraction to enable developers to focus on delivering business value.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>To run our applications, we require computing system resources like CPU, memory, disk, and network bandwidth to be allocated to the critical data services that power the applications. When we work on a single machine, the operating system takes care of managing the resources allocated to applications. But when we run on a cluster of machines, how can we perform the resource management required by this new generation of distributed data-intensive applications?</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Cluster managers, such as <a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org/\">Apache Mesos</a>, are an abstraction that runs on top of any computing infrastructure (public/private cloud, VM, bare metal) to provide a single unified resource pool across multiple infrastructures. Mesos achieves that unification by aggregating the infrastructure resources, and then offering resources slices, like <em>x</em> CPUs, <em>y</em> MB RAM, and <em>z</em> GB disk, to applications. Applications are then able to accept or reject those resources based on their own needs. Mesos can provide resources to execute applications and data services such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and HDFS, or container schedulers such as Kubernetes.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Deploying a cluster management solution like Mesosphere <a href=\"https://dcos.io/\">DC/OS</a> helps us take advantage of Mesos to deliver a complete fast-data platform by adding the deployment of standard components, providing a runtime for applications and delivering foundational services such as security and user management. It enables unbounded scalability as more commodity or specialized hardware can be seamlessly added to existing clusters.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>This results in increased enterprise agility as resources can be dynamically redirected to support the varying demands of different applications.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>Building fast data architectures that deliver scalable and resilient real-time applications is a challenging undertaking. The five recommendations that we have collected in this post should help you in your journey from requirements capture to cluster-wide deployment.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>A successful implementation of the fast data architecture will give your business the ability to accelerate its data-driven innovation by creating an environment to dynamically create, deploy, and operate end-to-end data-intensive applications. In turn, you will gain increased competitive advantage and the agility to react to your specific market challenges.</p>\r\n",

      "<p><img src='https://d3tdunqjn7n0wj.cloudfront.net/600x450/wall-2997629_1920_crop-f1d80cccf2838b3d222e6e7ad3a6d59e.jpg'/></p><p><em>The web was never supposed to be a few walled gardens of concentrated content owned by a few major publishers; it was supposed to be a cacophony of different sites and voices.</em></p><p>Anil Dash's <a href=\"https://medium.com/@anildash/the-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web-3fa490ae5cbc\">\"The Missing Building Blocks of the Web\"</a> is an excellent article about the web as it was supposed to be, using technologies that exist but have been neglected or abandoned. It's not his first take on the <a href=\"http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html\">technologies the web has lost</a>, or on the possibility of <a href=\"http://anildash.com/2012/12/rebuilding-the-web-we-lost.html\">rebuilding the web</a>, and I hope it's not his last. And we have to ask ourselves what would happen if we brought back those technologies: would we have a web that's more humane and better suited to the future we want to build?</p>\r\n",
      "<p>I've written several times (and will no doubt write more) about rebuilding the internet, but I've generally assumed the rebuild will need peer-to-peer technologies. Those technologies are inherently much more complex than anything Dash proposes. While many of the technologies I'd use already exist, rebuilding the web around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\">blockchains</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing\">onion routing</a> would require a revolution in user interface design to have a chance; otherwise it will be a playground for the technology elite. In contrast, Dash's \"missing building blocks\" are fundamentally simple. They can easily be used by people who don't have a unicorn's worth of experience as web developers and security administrators.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Dash writes about the demise of the View Source browser feature, which dispays the HTML from which the web page is built. View Source isn't dead, but it's sick. He's right that the web succeeded, in part, because people with little background could look at the source for the pages they liked, copy the code they wanted, and end up with something that looks pretty good. Today, you can no longer learn by copying; while View Source still exists on most browsers, the complexity of modern web pages have made it next to useless. The bits you want are wrapped in megabytes (literally) of JavaScript and CSS.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>But that doesn't have to be the end of the story. HTML can be functional without being complex. Most of what I write (including this piece) goes into a first draft as very simple HTML, using only a half-dozen tags. Simple editors for basic web content still exist. Dash points out that Netscape Gold (the paid version of Netscape) had one, back in the day, and that there are many free editors for basic HTML. We'd have to talk ourselves out of the very complex formatting and layout that, after all, just gets in the way. Ask (almost) any designer: simplicity wins, not a drop-dead gorgeous page. We may have made View Source useless, but we haven't lost simplicity. And if we make enough simple sites, sites from which viewers can effectively copy useful code, View Source will become useful again, too. You can't become a web developer by viewing Facebook's source; but you might by looking at a new site that isn't weighed down by all that CSS and JavaScript.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>The web was never supposed to be a few walled gardens of concentrated content owned by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and a few other major publishers. It was supposed to be a cacophony of different sites and voices. And it would be easy to rebuild this cacophony—indeed, it never really died. There are plenty of individual sites out there still, and they provide some (should I say most?) of the really valuable content on the web. The problem with the megasites is that they select and present \"relevant\" content to us. Much as we may complain about Facebook, selecting relevant content from an ocean of random sites is an important service. It's easy for me to imagine relatives and friends building their own sites for baby pictures, announcements, and general talk. That's what we did in the 90s. But would we go to the trouble of reading those all those sites? Probably not. I didn't in the 90s, and neither did you.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>We already have a tool for solving this problem. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> lets websites provide \"feeds\" of news and new items. Applications like <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> and <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> let you build a collection of sites that interest you, and show you what's changed since the last time you visited. While I'd never check a dozen sites each day, I use Feedly to monitor hundreds of websites. I would never check those sites by hand, but I scan Feedly every morning. And, unlike Facebook, Feedly doesn't know anything about its users except for the sites they read.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Feedly has a decent user interface, though it could be a improved; it would have to be better to become popular with people who aren't technically literate. (Sorry.) Still, though, the UI gap for RSS is much smaller than for technologies like <a href=\"https://tor.eff.org/\">TOR</a>. And if we're going to rebuild the net, we'll probably be better off choosing simple rather than bright, shiny, and complex technologies. Could someone build an RSS reader that made the web of independent sites as approachable as Facebook? I don't see why not—and users would have complete control over what they see. That's important; in a recent <a href=\"http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html\">tweet</a>, Dash says:</p>\r\n",
      "<blockquote>Google’s decision to kill Google Reader [their RSS client] was a turning point in enabling media to be manipulated by misinformation campaigns. The difference between individuals choosing the feeds they read and companies doing it for you affects all other forms of media.</blockquote>\r\n",
      "<p>Yes, there would still be plenty of sites for every conspiracy theory and propaganda project around; but in a world where you choose what you see rather than letting a third party decide for you, these sites would have trouble gaining momentum.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>I don't want to underestimate the difficulty of this project, or overestimate its chances of success. We'd certainly have to get used to sites that aren't as glossy or complex as the ones we have now. We might have to revisit some of the most hideous bits of the first-generation web, including those awful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\">GeoCities</a> pages. We would probably need to avoid fancy, dynamic websites; and, before you think this will be easy, remember that one of the first extensions to the static web was CGI Perl. We would be taking the risk that we'd re-invent the same mistakes that brought us to our current mess. Simplicity is a discipline, and not an easy one. However, by losing tons of bloat, we'd end up with a web that is much faster and more responsive than what we have now. And maybe we'd learn to prize that speed and that responsiveness.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>We'd also need to avoid many of the privacy and security flaws that were rampant in the early internet, and for which we're still paying. That technical debt came due a long time ago. Paying off that debt may require some complex technology, and some significant UI engineering. All too often, solutions to security problems make things more difficult for both users and attackers. <a href=\"https://shift.newco.co/sure-the-internet-is-broken-so-lets-go-fix-it-shall-we-5c27e294c25c\">Crowdflare's new 1.1.1.1 service</a> addresses some basic problems with our DNS infrastructure and privacy, and their CEO proposes some more basic changes, like DNS over HTTPS. But even simple changes like this require non-technical users to change configuration settings that they don't understand. This is where we really need the help of UX designers. We can't afford to make \"safe\" difficult.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>And we'd have to admit that our current web, with all its flaws, evolved from these simple building blocks. To some extent, then, it's what we wanted—or, perhaps, what we deserved. It's certainly what we accepted, and begs the question: \"why wouldn't we accept the same thing again?\" Starting over means little if we're destined to repeat the mistakes we've already made. So, we would need to develop and incorporate technology for preventing abuse; we would need to build a public space that really is a public space, not someone else's private property; and above all, we would need to divest ourselves of the arrogance that assumes \"because we've built it, it is good.\" As Dash said six years ago, well before Facebook's Very Bad Month, we would need to \"take responsibility and accept blame.\"</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Regardless of how it happens, it's time to start thinking about rebuilding the web. That project is only likely to succeed if the rebuilt web is compatible with what we have today, including Facebook and YouTube. And it's only likely to succeed if it's simple enough for anyone to use. Anil Dash has outlined a way forward. It's not what I would have suggested, but it has a much higher chance of succeeding. Time to (re)build it.</p>\r\n",

We are in the midst of a “data revolution,” where individuals and organizations can store and analyze massive amounts of information. Leveraging data can allow for surprising discoveries and innovations with the power to fundamentally alter society: from <a href=\"http://learningtocure.csail.mit.edu/\">applying machine learning to cancer research </a>to <a href=\"https://www.columbus.gov/smartcolumbus/home/\">harnessing data to create “smart” cities,</a> data science efforts are increasingly surfacing new insights—and new questions.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Working with large databases, new analytical tools, and data-enabled methods promises to bring many benefits to society. However, “data-driven technologies also challenge the fundamental assumptions upon which our societies are built,” says <a href=\"http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/people/fellows/margarita-boenig-liptsin/\">Margo Boenig-Liptsin</a>, co-instructor of UC Berkeley’s “<a href=\"https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/hce\">Human Contexts and Ethics of Data</a>” course. Boenig-Liptsin notes, “In this time of rapid social and technological change, concepts like ‘privacy,’ ‘fairness,’ and ‘representation’ are reconstituted.” Indeed, bias in algorithms may favor some groups over others, as evidenced by notorious cases such as the <a href=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/the-coded-gaze\">finding by MIT Researcher Joy Buolamwini</a> that certain facial recognition software fails to work for those with dark skin tones. Moreover, lack of transparency and data misuse at ever-larger scales has prompted calls for greater scrutiny on behalf of more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-data.html\">50 million Facebook users</a>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>In an era where <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146\">fake news travels faster than the truth</a>, our communities are at a critical juncture, and we need to be having difficult conversations about our individual and collective responsibility to handle data ethically. These conversations, and the principles and outcomes that emerge as a result, will benefit from being intentionally inclusive.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>What does responsible data sharing and use look like—for a data scientist, a parent, or a business? How are our socioeconomic structures and methods of interaction shaping behavior? How might we ensure that our technologies and practices are fair and unbiased?</p>\r\n",
      "<p>One idea that has gained traction is the need for a ‘Hippocratic Oath’ for data scientists. Just as medical professionals pledge to “do no harm,” individuals working with data should sign and abide by one or a set of <a href=\"https://medium.com/doteveryone/oaths-pledges-and-manifestos-a-master-list-of-ethical-tech-values-26e2672e161c\">pledges, manifestos, principles, or codes of conduct.</a> At Bloomberg’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/\">Data for Good Exchange (D4GX)</a> in New York City in September 2017, the company announced a partnership with <a href=\"http://datafordemocracy.org/projects/ethics.html\">Data for Democracy</a> and <a href=\"https://brighthive.io/\">BrightHive</a>to bring the data science community together to explore this very topic. More than 100 volunteers from universities, nonprofits, local and federal government agencies, and tech companies participated, drafting a set of guiding principles that could be adopted as a code of ethics. Notably, this is an ongoing and iterative process that must be community driven, respecting and recognizing the value of diverse thoughts and experiences.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>The group re-convened on February 6, 2018, at the inaugural D4GX event in San Francisco, again open to the public. Notable attendees included <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dpatil/a-code-of-ethics-for-data-science-cda27d1fac1\">DJ Patil</a>, who served as the chief data scientist of the United States from 2015-2017, Doug Cutting, co-creator of Hadoop and advocate for open source, as well as representation from the National Science Foundation-funded <a href=\"https://www.bigdatahubs.io/\">Regional Big Data Innovation Hubs and Spokes</a> program. At this event, participants reviewed more than 75 drafted ethics principles formulated by several working groups, with the goal of distilling a larger group of tenets into a streamlined set of principles for an ethics code.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Efforts such as Bloomberg’s D4GX can be situated in a growing movement, with increased interest in the ethical aspects of technology, particularly related to advances in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. For example, <a href=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.pdf\">AI Now 2017</a>, <a href=\"http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/ead_v1.pdf\">IEEE</a>, <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/\">The Future of Life Institute</a>, <a href=\"https://metrolabnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Applying-Predictive-Tools-within-Human-Services-2017.pdf\">Metro Lab Network</a>, the <a href=\"https://ethics.acm.org/2018-code-draft-2/\">ACM</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/efai/towards-a-code-of-ethics-for-artificial-intelligence/\">Oxford Internet Institute</a> have all issued reports on these topics. Plus, Microsoft’s Brad Smith and Harry Shum <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/01/17/future-computed-artificial-intelligence-role-society/\">published a book</a> entitled <a href=\"https://msblob.blob.core.windows.net/ncmedia/2018/02/The-Future-Computed_2.8.18.pdf\"><em>The Future Computed: Artificial intelligence and its role in society</em></a> earlier this year.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1741047\">National Science Foundation grant</a> focusing on the responsible use of big data was awarded to a group of researchers led by <a href=\"http://drexel.edu/cci/news-events/news/2017/December/drexel-cci-faculty-spotlight-julia-stoyanovich-phd-computer-science/\">Julia Stoyanovich</a>, an assistant professor at Drexel University, who has participated regularly in D4GX events in New York and San Francisco. The goal of this research project is to understand how legal and ethical norms can be embedded into technology, and to create tools that enable responsible collection, sharing, and analysis of data. These issues have also been a topic of discussion at multiple recent workshops. Last week, <a href=\"http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/guirr/PGA_184431\">a workshop at the National Academy of Sciences</a> focused on ethics and data in the context of international research collaborations. Similarly, <a href=\"https://cra.org/ccc/events/fair-representations-fair-interactive-learning/\">another recent workshop on fairness in machine learning</a> aimed to identify key challenges and open questions that limit fairness, both in theory and in practice.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>As noted in the AI Now 2017 report, there are powerful incentives for the commercial sector to disregard these initiatives in favor of business as usual. It is not clear how compliance and accountability could be incentivized, monitored, or enforced in both the public and private sectors, <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org/\">although new European Union regulations pertaining to data privacy</a> will affect organizations globally beginning in May 2018. “Top-down” regulations as well as “grassroots” efforts are increasingly raising questions about how we might define fairness, combat bias, and create ethics guidelines in data science and AI.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Yet, widespread adoption of ethical data collection and data analysis practices requires more than business penalties and awareness of these issues on the part of data science practitioners and the general public. Ultimately, data scientists and our broader community of data users must be equipped with the right tools and methodologies, and help each other leverage guidance effectively. Boenig-Liptsin notes, “We need to understand how our values shape our data tools and, reciprocally, how our data tools inform our values.” Successful efforts will require thoughtful and sustainable collaboration to apply insights and refine solutions.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>We are seeing an increasing number of <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">data practitioners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/13/593104213/ice-spokesman-quits-over-leaders-use-of-misleading-facts-to-discuss-calif-arrest\">leaders</a> stand up and speak about the questionable and often outright illegal collection, sharing, and use of sensitive data. For their voices to drive change, and for our society to truly harness the positive impacts of data innovation, while mitigating unintended consequences, we will need a collective effort. This effort needs to reach beyond academia and policymakers to anyone who can contribute—from both the public and private sectors.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Our community needs to collectively voice expectations for responsible data use, bringing data practitioners together to examine existing research and evidence. By creating environments, <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2017/11/20/robo-socrates-what-is-virtue.html\">curricula</a>, and tools that support community dialogue around ethics challenges, we can hope to translate findings into actionable <a href=\"https://datapractices.org/community-principles-on-ethical-data-sharing/\">principles</a>—and to hold each other accountable. In addition to working with regulatory bodies, the shaping of social norms can transform these principles into enforceable standards for the responsible use of data. As Barbara C. Jordan, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas, and professor of ethics at the University of Texas at Austin, eloquently stated in 1976:</p>\r\n",

Our novel method tackles coverage from a different angle: by removing sanity checks in the target program. T-Fuzz leverages a coverage-guided fuzzer to generate inputs. Whenever the fuzzer can no longer trigger new code paths, a lightweight, dynamic tracing-based technique detects the input checks that the fuzzer-generated inputs fail. These checks are then removed from the target program. Fuzzing then continues on the transformed program, allowing the code protected by the removed checks to be triggered and potential bugs discovered.</i>\r\n",

The most likely path to attaining quick turn-around would be to let non-programmers create their own applications—an approach that can be achieved with a combination of microservices, APIs, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The goal of letting non-programmers manipulate data is an old one. When IBM released early versions of the SQL programming language, they intended it for business users. They really expected a mid-level manager to sit down in the morning and type UPDATE PRODUCT.SPEC SET WIDTH = 19, HEIGHT = 12, DEPTH = 4 WHERE PRODUCT_NUM LIKE 'GK145%' onto a green screen. More realistically, though, SQL was hidden behind various forms that eventually moved to the web. But these forms do not offer the full power of the language.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>Visual programming, using some technique such as moving boxes around a screen to create control flows, has also been researched for decades. It is best known in children's educational tools such as <a href=\"https://www.alice.org/\">Alice</a> and MIT's <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\">Scratch</a>. The problem with trying to create large-scale applications using visual programming—and the reason I'm guessing that visual programming hasn't won a large user base—is that programming's complexity lies more in the mind than in the syntax. Exposing the complexity of control flow and math through boxes and lines doesn't make it easier than using words and punctuation.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>It may be quite a different matter, however, when powerful chunks of functionality, already hooked up to an organization's data sets and control structure, are offered in a visual interface, also known as a “low-code development platform.” For instance, an auto insurance assessor can do something really useful if she can automate part of her job by drawing a line between client information and a tool that calculates how much to pay for each part of a car.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Where do microservices enter the picture? They work at a higher level than function or library calls, offering precise access to specific data and services in the organization. I talked about microservices with Bruno Trimouille, a senior marketing executive at <a href=\"https://www.tibco.com/\">TIBCO Software</a>. He spoke of an airline that has microservices for travel services, customer profile data, flight information, and other elements of their workflow. Visual programming exposes all these things to the average employee. If someone in the luggage department thinks up an application that can find a bag more quickly or send a voucher to a customer's mobile phone, he can hook up services to create the application.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The low-code application environment can tap microservices to digitize a process that previously was done manually, such as submitting expenses or getting travel approval. It can also extend an existing system, or add some logic that stitches two microservices together.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As another example, Trimouille points to the problem of repricing in insurance. When an auto body shop takes apart a car, it often discovers new damage that the insurance assessor did not originally cover. The insurance company can upgrade its assessment tool to do repricing quickly and save both time and money.</p>\r\n",

We’ve seen AlphaGo touted as an example of deep learning. We’ve seen deep learning used for naming paint colors (not very successfully), imitating Rembrandt and other great painters, and many other applications. Deep learning has been successful in part because, as François Chollet tweeted, “you can achieve a surprising amount using only a small set of very basic techniques.” In other words, you can accomplish things with deep learning that don’t require you to become an AI expert. Deep learning’s apparent simplicity--the small number of basic techniques you need to know--makes it much easier to “democratize” AI, to build a core of AI developers that don’t have Ph.D.s in applied math or computer science. But having said that, there’s a deep problem with deep learning. As Ali Rahimi has argued, we can often get deep learning to work, but we aren’t close to understanding how, when, or why it works: “we’re equipping [new AI developers] with little more than folklore and pre-trained deep nets, then asking them to innovate. This allows RL models to benefit from research results and techniques used in many real-world applications. As someone who organizes AI conferences, I can attest to this: many of the proposals we receive are for standard machine learning applications. What’s most important about Jordan’s argument, though, is that we won’t get either IA or II if we focus solely on deep learning. It may even be a very small part.\n",

My mission with Relato was to build a deeper understanding of the modern networked economy, a vast network in which companies are best defined according to their business relationships with other companies. When it comes to understanding companies, it’s “who you know.” These relationships translate to connections in the business graph, made up of connections between customer, partner, competitor, and investor. By contrast, when I surveyed the websites of businesses, I found a treasure trove of information about their business relationships with other companies. Minting leads and dollars using graph analytics. Many other lead generation companies have attempted this task, but none that I could find used anything like Relato’s business graph to do so.

      "The two positions are not interchangeable—and misperceptions of their roles can hurt teams and compromise productivity.It’s important to understand the differences between a data engineer and a data scientist. Misunderstanding or not knowing these differences are making teams fail or underperform with big data. A key misunderstanding is the strengths and weaknesses of each position. I think some of these misconceptions come from the diagrams that are used to describe data scientists and data engineers. Figure 1. Overly simplistic venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers. Illustration by Jesse Anderson. Venn diagrams like Figure 1 oversimplify the complex positions and how they’re different. It makes the two positions seem interchangeable. Yes, both positions work on big data. However, what each position does to create value or data pipelines with big data is very different. This difference comes from the base skills of each position. When I work with organizations on their team structures, I don’t use a Venn diagram to illustrate the relationship between a data engineer and a data scientist. I draw the diagram as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Diagram showing the core competencies of data scientists and data engineers and their overlapping skills. Illustration by Jesse Anderson and the Big Data Institute. Data scientists’ skills\n",
      "At their core, data scientists have a math and statistics background (sometimes physics). Out of this math background, they’re creating advanced analytics. On the extreme end of this applied math, they’re creating machine learning models and artificial intelligence. Just like their software engineering counterparts, data scientists will have to interact with the business side. My one sentence definition of a data scientist is: a data scientist is someone who has augmented their math and statistics background with programming to analyze data and create applied mathematical models. They have an emphasis or specialization in distributed systems and big data. Using these engineering skills, they create data pipelines. Understanding each positions’ skills better, you can now understand the overlap. Data engineers use their programming and systems creation skills to create big data pipelines. This difference between creating and using lies at the core of a team's failure or underperforming with big data. When organizations get it wrong\n",
      "It’s unfortunately common for organizations to misunderstand the core skills and roles of each position. Some organizations believe that a data scientist can create data pipelines. I’ve talked to many data scientists at various organizations who were doing data engineer work. The general things to consider when choosing a ratio is how complex the data pipeline is, how mature the data pipeline is, and the level of experience on the data engineering team. There is an upward push as data engineers start to improve their math and statistics skills. The need for machine learning engineers\n",
      "Let’s face it—data scientists come from academic backgrounds. They don’t think in terms of creating systems, like an engineer. Diagram showing where a machine learning engineer fits with a data scientist and data engineer. Illustration by Jesse Anderson and the Big Data Institute. Machine learning engineers primarily come from data engineering backgrounds. This exactly where the machine learning engineer fits in, as shown in Figure 3. A machine learning engineer is responsible for taking what a data scientist finds or creates and making it production worthy (it’s worth noting that most of what a data scientist creates isn’t production worthy and is mostly hacked together enough to work). To be honest, we’re going to see similar revisions to what a machine learning engineer is to what we’ve seen with the definition of data scientists. To explain what I mean by slow moving, I will share the experience of those who I’ve seen make the transition from data engineer to machine learning engineer. Other times, they just got bored with the constraints of being a data engineer. To get truly accurate results, you would need a data scientist. Management could start delivering value against the promises of big data. You also met a new position, machine learning engineer.\n",

Today, there are a lot of tools in the ecosystem that can significantly decrease the time it takes to accomplish these tasks while also vastly improving the ability of individuals, teams, and organizations to reliably perform repetitive tasks successfully. That being said, tools have become such a big focus in the ecosystem that there are many people who haven’t really spent much time thinking about all the ways containers alone can provide interesting solutions to problems that can occur in the course of any technical task.
