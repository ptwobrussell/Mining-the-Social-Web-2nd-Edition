The code in this notebook harvests follower IDs and the corresponding account profiles for arbitrary accounts of interest along with some initial exercises to get you busy analyzing the data. We'll applly the same \"Aspire, Acquire, Analyze, Summarize\" data science framework that has been presented in previous posts as a guide through this notebook.\n\nFor the educational purpose of investigating the intuition behind popularity (number of followers) as a measure of influence on Twitter with a concrete set of data, Tim O'Reilly and his followers provide the primary basis of this examination. Sample output from the analysis section of the notebook is left in place for easy review.\n\nIn the spirit of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Rev-Ed-Riddles-Modern-ebook/dp/B002VL1CLW/?tag=oreonbl-20\">Freakonomics</a></em> (but mostly just for entertainment purposes), we'll also briefly juxtapose some of Tim O'Reilly's data with that of Lady Gaga to see what followers they have in common and even compute a Jaccard similarity score for them based on the followers that they have in common.\n\nBut a Jaccard score all by itself is no fun at all, so Marissa Mayer's data will also make a brief guest appearance so that we can make a couple of additional comparisons. The selection of Marissa Mayer seemed interesting since she's a female technologist and thus has something in common with both Tim O'Reilly and Lady Gaga (as arbitrary as that may seem.)"

Only about 15% of Marissa Mayer's followers are suspect according to the same criteria.\n    * Although purely speculative, this difference *might* be explainable by a massive wave of spam-bots attacking popular users back in 2009 when Twitter experiences unprecedented user growth.\n* Approximately 25% of Tim O'Reilly's \"non-suspect\" followers also follow Lady Gaga.\n* Lady Gaga has a higher Jaccard similarity to Tim O'Reilly than to Lady Gaga. (However, Tim O'Reilly and Marissa Mayer have a *much* higher Jaccard similarity to one another than either one of them have to Lady Gaga.)\n* The total number of followers that Tim O'Reilly, Marissa Mayer, and Lady Gaga have in common is about 25k. This figure represents about 5% of Marissa Mayer's total followers.\n\nThis remainder of this IPython notebook provides the source code and fodder to reproduce these results.

We'd need to do some more analysis to get a better idea of what other features we could inspect to determine the likelihood of these followers being spam-bots. I have completed some non-trivial analysis that will be presented \"soon\", but this is a good place for you to jump in. Data mining is not a spectator sport!\n\nSome recommended exercises for further analysis:\n\n* When were these suspect accounts created? (What you'll discover is that the majority of them were all created in the year 2009. Why might this be? Twitter experienced <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/05/twitter-data-analysis-an-investors-perspective-2/\">unprecedented growth</a> in early 2009. Perhaps there was an attach of spam bots that it was not yet well equipped to handle?)\n* When did these suspect accounts last tweet? Is there a correlation to account creation time?\n* How many of these accounts have changed profile images to something other than the default profile image?\n* Who are the most popular accounts that follow Tim O'Reilly and how influenceable are they likely to be? (One of these followers is high among the most popular users in the world -- almost as popular as Lady Gaga.)\n\nWe already have all of the data on hand to answer these questions and much more from the account profiles. The answers to these questions may surprise you.\n\nA more advanced exercise:\n\n* Try developing a heuristic (or better yet, using some supervised machine learning to build a classifier) to determine whether or not an account is likely to be spam bot as opposed just being an inactive account"

We can compute many interesting things without the full profiles for the 40M+ followers, and draw random samples from the full population of follower IDs for testing hypotheses that involve concrete account data.\n\nIn this section, we'll compute the followers that they have in common as well as the Jaccard similarity score.

     "source": "The Jaccard similarity is perhaps a more useful similarity score to employ when comparing sets of things than just a setwise intersection. For our context, Jaccard similarity is defined as the number of followers in common between the accounts divided by the combined number of unique followers if you were to merge the followers for each of those accounts. The effect here is that you are dividing the number of followers in common by a normalization term. A normalization term is appropriate, especially in this circumstance, because the cardinality of each set of followers is so different.\n\nComputing the Jaccard similarity between any two sets isn't very helpful unless you have some other reference points for comparison, so let's introduce another Twitter account that has something in common with both Tim O'Reilly and Lady Gaga. Marissa Mayer would be an interesting choice since she's a \"technology celebrity\" like Tim O'Reilly but also a female. (Admittedly that's a contrived explanation, but the original juxtaposition isn't any less contrived, so let's go with it and see what happens.)\n\nRecall that you can harvest all of Marissa Mayer's followers and the corresponding account profiles per the functions previously introduced and hack on the data to produce the very same working variables that we've been working with so far (and then some.)"

Given that their statuses as \"celebrity technologists\" or \"business leaders\" (amongst other things) are going to drive more interest than a basic variable like gender, the results are as we'd probably have expected them to be.\n\nThat said, how do we account for the (slightly) higher similarity score between Tim O'Reilly and Lady Gaga as compared to Lady Gaga and Marissa Mayer? One thought is that Tim O'Reilly's base of followers is substantially larger than Marissa Mayer's so the sheer numbers are probably the deciding factor.\n\nLet's re-run the numbers after adjusting for suspect followers to see if anything changes. (Although we aren't adjusting Lady Gaga's set of followers IDs by subtracting out the suspect followers, this should probably be fine for relative comparisons since it's a constant factor for each of the calculations.)"

This number as a percentage is significantly lower than Tim O'Reilly's. If you take a closer look at their account data you'll see that Tim O'Reilly was a very early user, creating an account in March 2007, and was already a popular and well-known user by 2009 when there was significant growth (and may have been a spam bot attack.) Marissa Mayer, on the other hand, didn't create an account until late November 2008, so she would likely not yet have been a popular user in early 2009 when the sharp growth occurred.\n\nLet's subtract out these suspect followers from the previously computed common set between Tim O'Reilly and Lady Gaga to see how many remain."

If there is sufficient interest, there may be an encore presentation that picks up from here.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSuggested exercises:\n\n* Apply similar analysis for the accounts that Tim O'Reilly, Lady Gaga, and Marissa Mayer are following (the accounts that they are *interested* in.) How influenceable are these accounts? What metrics would you apply to try and make this determination?\n* Would you expect that a higher percentage of females might follow Marissa Mayer than Tim O'Reilly? (You can analyze first names to get a reasonable idea of whether or not this is the case. See http://tedwise.com/check-name for a list of fist names that you can use.)\n* Pick a figure of your own choosing and introduce them to the comparison matrix. Who are they most similar to based upon the Jaccard similarity of their followers?"

That said, we did observe a few interesting things:\n\n* **Approximately 50% of Tim O'Reilly's followers are suspect**. In other words, these \"users\" may not be users at all. They may be spam-bots or abandoned accounts who are not influenceable at all.\n\n* In contrast, we discovered that **only ~15% of Marissa Mayer's followers were suspect** when applying the same criteria as that of Tim O'Reilly. \n\n    * Although purely speculative at this point, **there may have been a spam-bot attack in early 2009** that explains this given that the majority of Tim O'Reilly's suspect users are from that year, which is the same year that Twitter experiences unprecedented user growth. Further investigation would be needed to say for sure. (Marissa Mayer wouldn't yet have been a popular or well-known Twitter user back then since she didn't create an account until late 2008. Tim O'Reilly, on the other hand, was already an established and well-known user who would have been a ripe target for spam-bots.)\n\n* Tim O'Reilly and Lady Gaga have more than 250k followers in common with almost 225k of them passing the test of scrutiny. What's interesting about this finding is that it means that **roughly 25% of Tim O'Reilly's followers also follow Lady Gaga as compared to 18% for Marissa Mayer** once you filter out the suspect accounts.\n\n* Tim O'Reilly and Marissa Mayer have about 100k followers in common with 95k of these followers being non-suspect.\n\n* We computed Jaccard similarity for the combinations of Tim O'Reilly, Lady Gaga, and Marissa Mayer. Not too surprisingly, **Tim O'Reilly and Marissa Mayer had a higher Jaccard similarity than the other two possible combinations involving Lady Gaga**.\n\n* **Tim O'Reilly, Lady Gaga, and Marissa Mayer have more than 25k total followers in common** that have passed the initial test of scrutiny.\n\nSee <a href=\"http://wp.me/p3QiJd-4k\">http://wp.me/p3QiJd-4k</a> for a more detailed write-up of this summary."
