      "This IPython Notebook provides an interactive way to follow along with and explore the numbered examples from [_Mining the Social Web (2nd Edition)_](http://bit.ly/135dHfs).

This notebook assumes that you are reading along with the book and have the context of the discussion as you work through these exercises.\n",

      "While the chapters in the book opt to simplify the discussion by avoiding a discussion of OAuth and instead opting to use application credentials provided by social web properties for API access, this notebook demonstrates how to implement some OAuth flows for several of the more prominent social web properties. While IPython Notebook is used for consistency and ease of learning, and in some cases, this actually adds a little bit of extra complexity in some cases given the nature of embedding a web server and handling asynchronous callbacks. (Still, the overall code should be straightforward to adapt as needed.)"

      "\n",
      "Twitter implements OAuth 1.0A as its standard authentication mechanism, and in order to use it to make requests to Twitter's API, you'll need to go to https://dev.twitter.com/apps and create a sample application. There are three items you'll need to note for an OAuth 1.0A workflow, a consumer key and consumer secret that identify the application as well as the oauth_callback URL that tells Twitter where redirect back to after the user has authorized the application. Note that you will need an ordinary Twitter account in order to login, create an app, and get these credentials. Keep in mind that for development purposes or for accessing your own account's data, you can simply use the oauth token and oauth token secret that are provided in your appliation settings to authenticate as opposed to going through the steps here. The process of obtaining an the oauth token and oauth token secret is fairly straight forward (especially with the help of a good library), but an implementation in IPython Notebook is a bit tricker due to the nature of embedding a web server, capturing information within web server contexts, and handling the various redirects along the way.\n",
