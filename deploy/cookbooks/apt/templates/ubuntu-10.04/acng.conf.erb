# Usually, general purpose proxies like Squid expose the IP address of the
# client user to the remote server using the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. This
# behaviour can be optionally turned on with the Expose-Origin option.
# ExposeOrigin: 0

# When logging the originating IP address, trust the information supplied by
# the client in the X-Forwarded-For header.
# LogSubmittedOrigin: 0

# The version string reported to the peer, to be displayed as HTTP client (and
# version) in the logs of the mirror.
# WARNING: some archives use this header to detect/guess capabilities of the
# client (i.e. redirection support) and change the behaviour accordingly, while
# ACNG might not support the expected features. Expect side effects.

# In some cases the Import and Expiration tasks might create fresh volatile
# data for internal use by reconstructing them using patch files. This
# by-product might be recompressed with bzip2 and with some luck the resulting
# file becomes identical to the *.bz2 file on the server, usable for APT
# clients trying to fetch the full .bz2 compressed version. Injection of the
# generated files into the cache has however a disadvantage on underpowered
# servers: bzip2 compression can create high load on the server system and the
# visible download of the busy .bz2 files also becomes slower.
#
# RecompBz2: 0

# Network timeout for outgoing connections.
# NetworkTimeout: 60

# Sometimes it makes sense to not store the data in cache and just return the
# package data to client as it comes in. DontCache parameters can enable this
# behaviour for certain URL types. The tokens are extended regular expressions
# that URLs are matched against.
#
# DontCacheRequested is applied to the URL as it comes in from the client.
# Example: exclude packages built with kernel-package for x86
# DontCacheRequested: linux-.*_10\...\.Custo._i386
# Example usecase: exclude popular private IP ranges from caching
# DontCacheRequested: 192.168.0 ^10\..* 172.30
#
# DontCacheResolved is applied to URLs after mapping to the target server. If
# multiple backend servers are specified then it's only matched against the
# download link for the FIRST possible source (due to implementation limits).
# Example usecase: all Ubuntu stuff comes from a local mirror (specified as
# backend), don't cache it again:
# DontCacheResolved: ubuntumirror.local.net
#
# DontCache directive sets (overrides) both, DontCacheResolved and
# DontCacheRequested.  Provided for convenience, see those directives for
# details.
#
# Default permission set of freshly created files and directories, as octal
# numbers (see chmod(1) for details).
# Can by limited by the umask value (see umask(2) for details) if it's set in

# in its configuration file.

# It's possible to use use apt-cacher-ng as a regular web server with limited
# feature set, i.e. 
# including directory browsing and download of any file;
# excluding sorting, mime types/encodings, CGI execution, index page
# redirection and other funny things.
# To get this behavior, mappings between virtual directories and real
# directories on the server must be defined with the LocalDirs directive.
# Virtual and real dirs are separated by spaces, multiple pairs are separated
# by semi-colons. Real directories must be absolute paths.
# NOTE: Since the names of that key directories share the same namespace as
# repository names (see Remap-...) it's administrators job to avoid such
# collisions on them (unless created deliberately).

# Precache a set of files referenced by specified index files. This can be used
# to create a partial mirror usable for offline work. There are certain limits
# and restrictions on the path specification, see manual for details. A list of

# "apt-get --print-uris update" on a client machine.

# Regular expiration algorithm finds package files which are no longer listed

# Optionally uses TCP access control provided by libwrap, see hosts_access(5)

# If many machines from the same local network attempt to update index files
# (apt-get update) at nearly the same time, the known state of these index file
# is temporarily frozen and multiple requests receive the cached response
# without contacting the server. This parameter (in seconds) specifies the
# length of this period before the files are considered outdated.
# Setting it too low transfers more data and increases remote server load,
# setting it too high (more than a couple of minutes) increases the risk of
# delivering inconsistent responses to the clients.
# FreshIndexMaxAge: 27

# Usually the users are not allowed to specify custom TCP ports of remote
# mirrors in the requests, only the default HTTP port can be used (instead,
# proxy administrator can create Remap- rules with custom ports). This
# restriction can be disabled by specifying a list of allowed ports or 0 for
# any port.
#
# AllowUserPorts: 80

# Normally the HTTP redirection responses are forwarded to the original caller
# (i.e. APT) which starts a new download attempt from the new URL. This
# solution is ok for client configurations with proxy mode but doesn't work
# well with configurations using URL prefixes. To work around this the server
# can restart its own download with another URL. However, this might be used to
# circumvent download source policies by malicious users.
# The RedirMax option specifies how many such redirects the server should
# follow per request, 0 disables the internal redirection. If not set,
# default value is 0 if ForceManaged is used and 5 otherwise.
#
# RedirMax: 5
