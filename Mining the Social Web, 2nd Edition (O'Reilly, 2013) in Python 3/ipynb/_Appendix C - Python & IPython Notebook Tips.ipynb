    "An alternative to using the envoy package to interact with the virtual machine through what is called \"Bash Cell Magic\" in IPython Notebook. The way it works is that if you write <code>%%bash</code> on the first line of a cell, IPython Notebook will automatically take the remainder of the cell and execute it as a [Bash](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) script on the machine where the server is running. In case you come from a Windows background or are a Mac user who hasn't yet encountered Bash, it's the name of the default shell on most Linux systems, including the virtual machine that runs the IPython Notebook server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you are using the virtual machine, this means that you can essentially write bash scripts in IPython Notebook cells and execute them on the server. The following script demonstrates some of the possibilities, including how to use a command like <code>wget</code> to download a file."

    "The Vagrant virtual machine maps the top level directory of your GitHub checkout (the directory containing _README.md_) on your host machine to its _/vagrant_ folder and automatically synchronizes files between the guest and host environments as an incredible convenience to you. This mapping and synchronization enables IPython Notebooks you are running on the guest machine to access files that you can conveniently manage on your host machine and vice-versa. For example, many of the scripts in IPython Notebooks may write out data files and you can easily access those data files on your host environment (should you desire to do so) without needing to connect into the virtual machine with an SSH session. On the flip side, you can provide data files to IPython Notebook, which is running on the guest machine by copying them anywhere into your top level GitHub checkout. \n",

    "IPython Notebook's server kernels are ordinary Python processes that will use as much memory as they need to perform the computation that you give them. Most of the examples in this book do not entail consuming very large amounts of memory (the only notable exception could be Example 7-12 that builds a fairly large in-memory graph), but it's worth noting that most Vagrant boxes, including the default configuration for this book's virtual machine, have fairly low amounts of memory allocated to them by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of memory that's available for the \"precise64\" box that's used for these notebooks, for example, ships with a default of 334MB of memory that's allocated to it. Consequently, if any of your IPython Notebooks ever consume close to 334MB of memory, you'll reach the limit that's allocated to the guest virtual machine and the kernel will kill the offending Python process. Unfortunately, IPython Notebook isn't able to provide a clear indication of what's gone wrong in this case, so your only clue as to what may have happened is that you'll no longer see a \"Kernel Busy\" message in the upper-right corner of the screen, and your variables in the notebook become undefined because the IPython Notebook kernel that's servicing the notebook has effectively restarted.\n",
