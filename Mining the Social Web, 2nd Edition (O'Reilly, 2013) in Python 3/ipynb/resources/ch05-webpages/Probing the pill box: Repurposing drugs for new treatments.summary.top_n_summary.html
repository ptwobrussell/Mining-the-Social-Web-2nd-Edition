With the development of new medicines often exceeding 10 years and topping $1 billion, faster and cheaper methods of drug development are sorely needed.</strong> <strong>Drug repurposing, whereby drugs approved for one condition are used to treat a completely different disease, is a fast-emerging strategy aimed at circumventing this daunting pipeline.</strong>  <strong>Several biotechnology companies now specialize in identifying new drug-disease pairs by interrogating massive biomedical datasets with ever-evolving artificial intelligence algorithms.</strong> <strong>This systematic approach to repurposing, augmenting the chance application of drugs to new diseases, represents a powerful tool for producing new medicines.</strong> <strong>Indeed, major drug companies such as GlaxoSmithKline have committed to probing “dark data,” or failed trial data, to achieve this goal.</strong>
The Promise of Drug Repositioning
The time and money required to bring a new drug to market severely limits the number of new treatments, in part explaining the steady decline in the number of approved drugs entering use each year. The drug development process, overseen in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has three main stages. Candidate compounds, which are being generated in abundance by discovery science and have established mechanisms of action, safe dosages, and a pharmacokinetic profile, begin in Phase I trials. In this trial stage, the safety profile of the compound is established, usually in healthy volunteers. Promising candidates are selected for Phase II trials, which determine the effectiveness of the compound at treating a particular disease or indication in a small sample group. Positive candidates are admitted to a Phase III trial, which takes place in a larger patient population, where the efficacy of the drug and its side-effects are fully assessed.Continue reading Probing the pill box: Repurposing drugs for new treatments.</p></body>
