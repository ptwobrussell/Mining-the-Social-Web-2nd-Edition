BAN.AI Multics -- free multiuser Multics (predecessor to Unix) emulation.</strong> This Multics guide will be useful.

The Art of Relevance -- explores how mission-driven organizations can matter more to more people. <strong>The book is packed with inspiring examples, rags-to-relevance case studies, research-based frameworks, and practical advice on how your work can be more vital to your community.</strong> Should be read by startups (relevant to your customers?) and anyone who is trying to build a community around their software. <strong>Text available for free online, print versions still available for purchase.</strong>

VoiceLoop: Voice Fitting and Synthesis via a Phonological Loop -- We present a new neural text to speech (TTS) method that is able to transform text to speech in voices that are sampled in the wild. <strong>Unlike other systems, our solution is able to deal with unconstrained voice samples and without requiring aligned phonemes or linguistic features.</strong> The Presidential voices are impressive. Code and paper available.

No Boundaries for Facebook Data -- Today we report yet another type of surreptitious data collection by third-party scripts that we discovered: the exfiltration of personal identifiers from websites through “login with Facebook” and other such social login APIs. Specifically, we found two types of vulnerabilities: seven third parties abuse websites’ access to Facebook user data; one third party uses its own Facebook “application” to track users around the web.
