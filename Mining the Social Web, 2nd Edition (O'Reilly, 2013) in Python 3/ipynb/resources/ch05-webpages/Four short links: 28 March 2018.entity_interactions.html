    <body><strong>Business</strong> <strong>Logic</strong>, <strong>Digital Forgery</strong>, <strong>Twitter Demetricator</strong>, and <strong>ML</strong> for <strong>Kids</strong>

The <strong>Business</strong> <strong>Logic</strong> of <strong>Silicon Valley</strong> (<strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>) -- Selling <strong>hardware</strong> does not have exponential <strong>growth potential</strong>, because <strong>people</strong> only need so many <strong>sex</strong> <strong>toys</strong>, and really successful <strong>models</strong> are likely to be cloned or imitated, driving down the price. For a "smart" <strong><strong>sex toy</strong> startup</strong> to <strong>cash</strong> out its <strong>investors</strong>, it will need to have a second, much more profitable <strong>business</strong>, and that, inevitably, is private <strong>data</strong> about <strong>sex toy</strong> users. <strong>Commoditization</strong> of <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>Digital Forgery</strong>, and the <strong>End</strong> of <strong>Trust</strong> -- Once <strong>tools</strong> for <strong>fabrication</strong> become a <strong>commodity</strong>, the <strong>effects</strong> will be more dramatic than the current <strong>phenomenon</strong> of fake news.
