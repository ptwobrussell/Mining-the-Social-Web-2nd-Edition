    <body>Both reproducible <strong>science</strong> and open <strong>source</strong> are necessary for <strong>collaboration</strong> at scale—the <strong>nexus</strong> for that <strong>intermingling</strong> is Jupyter. (<strong>Apologies</strong> to <strong>Ray Kurzweil</strong> for the <strong>title puns</strong>)
<strong>Recent</strong> one-day <strong><strong>event</strong>s</strong> showcased the <strong>Jupyter</strong> <strong>community</strong> in <strong>Boston</strong> and <strong>Atlanta</strong>, with another <strong>Jupyter</strong> Pop-up <strong>event</strong> coming on <strong>May</strong> 15 in <strong>Washington</strong>, <strong>D.C.</strong> At the same <strong>time</strong>, Project <strong>Jupyter</strong> has been in the news. We’re finding <strong>overlap</strong> between the <strong>themes</strong> explored at these <strong>community</strong> <strong>events</strong> and recent <strong>articles</strong> written about Jupyter. That <strong>overlap</strong>, in <strong>turn</strong>, illustrates the <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong>dialog</strong> that we’re looking forward to at <strong>JupyterCon</strong> this August. In the <strong>news</strong>, notably there was the <strong>James Somers</strong> <strong>article</strong>, “The <strong>Scientific Paper</strong> Is Obsolete”, in The <strong>Atlantic</strong>, and a subsequent <strong>piece</strong>, “Jupyter, <strong>Mathematica</strong>, and the <strong>Future</strong> of the Research Paper”, by <strong>Paul Romer</strong>, former chief <strong>economist</strong> at the World Bank. Both <strong>articles</strong> compare and contrast between Wolfram Research’s <strong>Mathematica</strong> and Project Jupyter. On the <strong>surface</strong> these two <strong>approaches</strong> both implement <strong>notebooks</strong>, with excellent <strong>examples</strong> coming from both communities. However, <strong>Paul Romer</strong> nailed the <strong>contrast</strong> between them with a <strong>one-liner</strong>: “The tie-breaker is social, not technical. The more I learn about the open <strong>source community</strong>, the more I trust its members.”
Under the <strong>surface</strong>, the parallels end. Mathematica, which came first, is a popular commercial software product. <strong>Jupyter</strong> is an open <strong>standard</strong> for a <strong>suite</strong> of <strong>network</strong> <strong>protocols</strong> that support remote <strong>execution</strong> <strong>environments</strong>—plus a <strong>spectrum</strong> of open <strong>source software</strong> <strong>projects</strong> that build extensible <strong>environments</strong> atop, such as <strong>Jupyter</strong>Lab, <strong>Jupyter</strong>Hub, Binder, etc. <strong>Organizations</strong> leverage <strong>Jupyter</strong> as a <strong>foundation</strong> for shared <strong>data</strong> <strong>infrastructure</strong> at scale. Organizational <strong>challenges</strong> emerge along with those <strong>implementations</strong> at <strong>scale</strong>: <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>discovery</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, <strong>compliance</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>ethics</strong>, provenance, etc. Through this open, community-centered <strong>approach</strong>, we get open <strong>standards</strong>, open <strong>source</strong> <strong>implementations</strong>, and open <strong>discussions</strong> about best <strong>practices</strong> for shared concerns. For common <strong>th<strong>re</strong>ads</strong> between the two, James Somers<strong><strong>’</strong></strong> <strong>distillation</strong> is subtle: <strong>“</strong><strong>Softwa<strong>re</strong></strong> is a dynamic <strong>medium</strong>; <strong>paper isn</strong><strong><strong>’</strong></strong><strong>t.</strong>” It<strong><strong>’</strong></strong>s been 27 <strong>years</strong> since the public <strong>debut</strong> of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, though we<strong><strong>’</strong></strong><strong>re</strong> still ba<strong>re</strong>ly scratching the <strong>surface</strong> of what that invention made possible. <strong>Frankly</strong>, an overwhelming <strong>amount</strong> of <strong>“</strong>digital paper” persists on the web. While the <strong>promise</strong> of <strong>WWW</strong> <strong>implies</strong> dynamic, interactive <strong>media</strong> shared across global <strong>infrastructure</strong>, questions linger about how best to make it happen. Some of those questions have also been in the news recently. Rolling the <strong>clock</strong> back a few <strong>decades</strong> further, one <strong>gem</strong> on my <strong>bookshelf</strong> is <strong>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</strong>, by Ted Nelson, first published in 1974. <strong>Nelson</strong> explored <strong>hypertext</strong>, which he’d been working to implement since 1963—though, arguably, that <strong>notion</strong> traces back to <strong>Vannevar Bush</strong> and Jorge Luis Borges in the 1940s. To capture the <strong>essence</strong> of <strong>hypertext</strong>, <strong>Computer Lib</strong> also introduced the <strong>concept</strong> of "<strong>intertwingularity</strong>": complex <strong>interrelations</strong> within human knowledge. Nelson<strong>’</strong>s <strong>vision</strong> had <strong>documents</strong> representing the <strong>world</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s knowledge</strong>, <strong>documents</strong> which could interact and intermingle. <strong>Borges</strong> prefigured a poetic <strong>glimpse</strong> of this in his 1941 short <strong>story</strong>, <strong>El</strong> <strong>jardín</strong> de senderos que se <strong>bifurcan</strong>: the <strong>legend</strong> of Ts’ui <strong>Pên</strong> constructing an infinite <strong>labyrinth</strong>, in which all would lose their <strong>way</strong>, along with a <strong>WWII</strong> <strong>espionage drama</strong> unfolding around that <strong>legend</strong>. Out of the many <strong>neologisms</strong> and <strong>one-liners</strong> that have attempted to describe <strong>Jupyter</strong>, <strong>intertwingularity</strong> nails it. One may “perform <strong>science</strong>” by authoring a <strong>research paper</strong> in a journal. That’<strong>s</strong> <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>cience</<strong>s</strong>trong> with a <<strong>s</strong>trong>lowerca<strong>s</strong>e</<strong>s</strong>trong> <<strong>s</strong>trong>“</<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>,<strong>”</strong> on <strong>paper</strong> or <strong>s</strong>omething approximating it—merey navigating a <strong>s</strong>ingle <strong>corner</strong> of T<strong>s</strong>’ui Pên’<strong>s</strong> labyrinth. Ted Nelson’<strong>s vision</strong>, however, had documents interacting, intermingling. The <strong>practice</strong> of reproducible <strong>science</strong>, which is rapidly unfolding around <strong>Jupyter</strong>, also relies on documents interacting and intermingling. That opens the <strong>door</strong> to <strong>software</strong> as a dynamic <strong>medium</strong>, "<strong>Science</strong>" with an uppercase “S.<strong>”</strong> Not merely a <strong>library</strong> of “digital <strong>paper</strong>,<strong>”</strong> but an entirely new <strong>way</strong> of <strong>collaborating</strong>, extending our understanding. Potentially as a map through the entire labyrinth. Reproducible <strong>science</strong> via <strong>Jupyter</strong> finds immediate <strong>applications</strong> in many places. Certainly there are the <strong>“</strong>hard <strong>sciences</strong><strong>”</strong>: at <strong>JupyterCon</strong>, we’ll have <strong>session</strong> <strong>talks</strong> ranging across <strong>astrophysics</strong>, quantum <strong>chemistry</strong>, <strong>genomics</strong>, geospatial <strong>analysis</strong>, <strong>climatology</strong>, and scientific computing in general. During the <strong>Jupyter Day Atlanta</strong> <strong>event</strong>, one excellent <strong>example</strong> was “<strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>Characterization</strong> of <strong>Metal Powder</strong> in <strong>Additive Manufacturing</strong> using <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong>,<strong>”</strong> by <strong>Anna Smith</strong> from CMU. Beyond <<strong>s</strong>trong>re<strong>s</strong>earch</<strong>s</strong>trong>, reproducible <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>cience</<strong>s</strong>trong> i<strong>s</strong> vital for any <<strong>s</strong>trong>organization</<strong>s</strong>trong> that depend<strong>s</strong> on <<strong>s</strong>trong>analy<strong>s</strong>i<strong>s</strong>—and</<strong>s</strong>trong> that <<strong>s</strong>trong>form<strong>s</strong></<strong>s</strong>trong> Jupyter’<strong>s</strong> direct <strong>link</strong> to data <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>cience</<strong>s</strong>trong>. During the <strong><strong>Jupyter</strong> Pop-up Boston</strong> <strong>event</strong>, <strong>Dave Stuart</strong> presented “Citizen Data Science <strong>campaign</strong>,” about an open <strong>source project</strong> called <strong>nbgallery</strong>, which <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong>DoD</strong> <strong>analysts</strong> use to discover and <strong>share</strong> <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebooks. While some <strong>teams</strong> have computational <strong>needs</strong> in common, they may not be allowed to <strong>share</strong> data. Similar <strong>data</strong> <strong>privacy</strong> <strong>concerns</strong> are encountered in <strong>finance</strong>, <strong>health care</strong>, social media, etc. The <strong>DoD</strong> <strong>project</strong> provides a fascinating <strong>approach</strong> to discovery (<strong>search</strong>, <strong>recommendations</strong>) for interactive <strong>content</strong> in highly regulated <strong>enterprise</strong> environments. In <strong>Atlanta</strong>, two <strong>industry use</strong> <strong>cases</strong> addressed similar <strong>needs</strong>: <strong>Peter Parente</strong> from <strong>Valassis Digital</strong> with “Give a <strong>Little Bit</strong> of <strong>Your Notebooks</strong> to Me”—also about sharing and discovering <strong>notebook content</strong> across an <strong>enterprise organization—and</strong> <strong>John Patanian</strong> from <strong>General Electric</strong> with “Achieving Reproducible and <strong>Deployable Data Science Workflows</strong>,” about using <strong>templates</strong> for reproducible workflows. <strong>Dave Stuart</strong> and <strong>Peter Parente</strong> will both be presenting at the <strong>Jupyter Pop-up D.C.</strong> event. Similar efforts are changing the classroom. In <strong>Boston</strong>, we had <strong>Allen Downey</strong>, <strong>Taylor Martin</strong>, and <strong>Doug Blank</strong> join the “<strong>Jupyter</strong> in Education” panel. In particular, reproducible <strong>science</strong> via <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebooks helps <strong>instructors</strong> manage the <strong>scaffolding</strong> needed to make <strong>course</strong> <strong>materials</strong> more engaging, more immediately hands-on, to give <strong>learners</strong> <strong>confidence</strong> and direct experience. Ryan <strong>Cooper</strong> from <strong>UConn</strong> presented <strong>“</strong>Flipping the <strong>classroom</strong> with <strong>Jupyter</strong> and GitHub” as a case study for this. In <strong>Atlanta</strong>, <strong>Carol Wi<strong>ll</strong>ing</strong> guided us through several exce<strong>ll</strong>ent <strong>examples</strong> in “STEAM Workshops with <strong>Binder</strong> and <strong>Jupyter</strong>Hub.<strong>”</strong>

At the <strong>D.C.</strong> <strong>event</strong>, we’<strong>ll</strong> have Lorena <strong>Barba</strong> from <strong>GWU</strong> presenting “Flipped Learning with <strong>Jupyter</strong>,<strong>”</strong> and <strong>Laura Norén</strong> from <strong>NYU Center</strong> for <strong>Data Science</strong> presenting “<strong>Data Science</strong> in <strong>U.S.</strong> and Canadian Higher Education.<strong>”</strong>

At a higher <strong>level</strong> of <strong>abstraction</strong>, reproducible <strong>science</strong> has an <strong>impact</strong> on computer <strong>science</strong>. In <strong>Boston</strong>, <strong>David Koop</strong> and <strong>Colin Brown</strong> from <strong>UMassD</strong> presented “Supporting Reproducibility in <strong>Jupyter</strong> through Dataflows.” Also, see a related <strong>project</strong> called <strong>Nodebook</strong> at <strong>Stitch Fix</strong> by Kevin Zielnicki. By <strong>default</strong>, <strong>cells</strong> in a <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> run from <strong>top</strong> to bottom—although, a <strong>person</strong> needs to “<strong>Run All</strong>” to be sure that results are correct. The <strong>Dataflows</strong> and <strong>Nodebook</strong> <strong>projects</strong> track <strong>inputs</strong> and <strong>outputs</strong> for each <strong>cell</strong> so that <strong>notebooks</strong> can be guaranteed to “rerun” successfully. The <strong>UMassD</strong> <strong>project</strong> also allows for rearranging <strong><strong>cell</strong> order</strong>: for <strong>example</strong>, while you may need a long <strong>list</strong> of <strong>Python</strong> <strong>imports</strong> to initialize a <strong><strong>notebook</strong></strong>, why not move that <strong>cell</strong> to the <strong>end</strong>, so that the initial <strong>part</strong> of a <strong><strong>notebook</strong></strong> can jump directly into core code? On the one hand, that supports better scaffolding. On the other <strong>hand</strong>, these <strong>projects</strong> represent <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong> as <strong>dependency graphs</strong>, with pre- and <strong>post-conditions</strong> for each cell. That’s only a few <strong>steps</strong> away from <strong>Petri</strong> <strong>nets</strong> and other <strong>automata</strong> used for formal <strong>analysis</strong> of <strong>computer</strong> <strong>programs</strong>, <strong>concurrency</strong>, <strong>business process</strong>, <strong>reliability engineering</strong>, <strong>security</strong> audits, etc. An imaginable next <strong>step</strong> could be to leverage <strong>machine</strong> learning to start generating <strong>unit tests—and</strong> for code gen in general. Here<strong>’</strong>s an intertwingled <strong>idea</strong> that weaves together most of the above. <strong>Generations</strong> of modern <strong><strong>science</strong></strong> have brought us to a <strong>point</strong> where reproducible <strong><strong>science</strong></strong> becomes a priority. Collaboration at a global scale can’t proceed further without it. Meanwhile, open <strong>source software</strong>, since roughly 1998, has similarly evolved to support <strong>collaboration</strong> at a global <strong>scale</strong>, leading to standard <strong>practices</strong> such as <strong>versioning</strong> (e.g., <strong>git</strong>), testing, <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>pull</strong> requests, etc. Most of those practices support reusability. Adding some <strong>DevOps</strong>, continuous integration/continuous <strong>deployment</strong> is the <strong>software analogy</strong> for reproducible science. We’<strong>re</strong> at a <strong>point</strong> whe<strong>re</strong> those two cultu<strong>re</strong>s, <strong>science</strong> and open source, have much to learn from each other. <strong>Science</strong> must learn to reuse and improve common <strong><strong>software</strong></strong> <strong>tools</strong>, while <strong><strong>software</strong></strong> must embrace reproducible science. Both are necessary for collaboration at scale. The <strong>nexus</strong> for that <strong>intermingling</strong> is <strong>Jupyter</strong>, where (and when) <strong>humans</strong> move beyond using digital <strong>mimics</strong> of <strong>print</strong> <strong>media</strong> to take better <strong>advantage</strong> of what <strong>software</strong> and <strong>collaboration promise</strong> in the long term. At the <strong>D.C.</strong> <strong>event</strong>, <strong>Tony Fast</strong> wi<strong>ll</strong> present “A <strong>Notebook</strong> is a <strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Blending the <strong>paradigms</strong> of modern <strong>science</strong> and open <strong>source software.</strong>”
