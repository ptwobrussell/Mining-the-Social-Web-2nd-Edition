    <body><strong>Game Networking</strong>, <strong>Grep JSON</strong>, <strong>Voting Ideas</strong>, and <strong>UIs</strong> from Pictures

Valve's <strong>Networking Code</strong> -- a basic <strong>transport layer</strong> for games. The <strong>features</strong> are: connection-oriented <strong><strong>protocol</strong></strong> (like <strong>TCP</strong>)...but message-oriented instead of stream-oriented; <strong>mix</strong> of reliable and unreliable <strong><strong>messages</strong></strong>; <strong><strong>messages</strong></strong> can be larger than underlying <strong>MTU</strong>, the <strong><strong>protocol</strong></strong> performs <strong>fragmentation</strong> and reassembly, and <strong>retransmission</strong> for reliable; bandwidth <strong>estimation</strong> based on <strong>TCP</strong>-friendly <strong>rate control</strong> (<strong>RFC</strong> 5348); <strong>encryption</strong>; <strong>AES</strong> per <strong>packet</strong>, <strong>Ed25519</strong> <strong>crypto</strong> for key <strong>exchange</strong> and cert <strong>signatures</strong>; the <strong>details</strong> for shared key <strong>derivation</strong> and per-<strong>packet</strong> <strong>IV</strong> are based on <strong>Google QUIC</strong>; <strong>tools</strong> for simulating <strong>loss</strong> and detailed <strong>stats</strong> measurement. <strong>gron</strong> -- grep <strong>JSON</strong> from the command line. The <strong>Problem</strong> With <strong>Voting</strong> -- I don't agree with all of the <strong>analysis</strong>, but the proposed techniques are interesting. I did like the <strong>term</strong> "lazy <strong><strong>consensus</strong></strong>" where <strong><strong>consensus</strong></strong> is assumed to be the <strong><strong>default</strong> state</strong> (i.e., “<strong>default</strong> to yes”). The underlying theory is that most proposals are not interesting enough to discuss. But if <strong>anyone</strong> does object, a <strong>consensus</strong> seeking <strong>process</strong> begins.

<strong>pix2code</strong> -- open <strong><strong>source code</strong></strong> that generates <strong>Android</strong>, <strong>iOS</strong>, and web <strong><strong>source code</strong></strong> for a <strong>UI</strong> from just a photo. It's not coming for your <strong>job</strong> any <strong>time</strong> soon (over 77<strong>%</strong> of <strong>accuracy</strong>), but it's still a nifty idea. (via Two <strong>Minute</strong> <strong>Papers</strong>)
