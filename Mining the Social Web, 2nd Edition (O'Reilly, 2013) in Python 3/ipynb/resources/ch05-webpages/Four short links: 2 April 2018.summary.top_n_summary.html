Valve's Networking Code -- a basic transport layer for games.</strong> <strong>The features are: connection-oriented protocol (like TCP)...but message-oriented instead of stream-oriented; mix of reliable and unreliable messages; messages can be larger than underlying MTU, the protocol performs fragmentation and reassembly, and retransmission for reliable; bandwidth estimation based on TCP-friendly rate control (RFC 5348); encryption; AES per packet, Ed25519 crypto for key exchange and cert signatures; the details for shared key derivation and per-packet IV are based on Google QUIC; tools for simulating loss and detailed stats measurement.</strong>
