    <body>The <strong><strong>web</strong></strong> was never supposed to be a few walled <strong>gardens</strong> of concentrated <strong>content</strong> owned by a few major <strong>publishers</strong>; it was supposed to be a <strong>cacophony</strong> of different <strong>sites</strong> and voices.Anil <strong>Dash</strong>'s "The <strong>Missing Building Blocks</strong> of the <strong>Web</strong>" is an excellent <strong>article</strong> about the <strong><strong>web</strong></strong> as it was supposed to be, using technologies that exist but have been neglected or abandoned. It's not his first take on the <strong>technologies</strong> the <strong>web</strong> has lost, or on the <strong>possibility</strong> of rebuilding the <strong>web</strong>, and I hope it's not his last. And we have to ask ourselves what would happen if we brought back those <strong>technologies</strong>: would we have a <strong>web</strong> that's more <strong>humane</strong> and better suited to the future we want to build? I've written several <strong>times</strong> (and will no doubt write more) about <strong>rebuild</strong>ing the <strong>internet</strong>, but I've generally assumed the <strong>rebuild</strong> will need peer-to-peer technologies. Those <strong>technologies</strong> are inherently much more complex than <strong>anything</strong> Dash proposes. While many of the <strong>technologies</strong> I'd use already exist, rebuilding the <strong>web</strong> around <strong>blockchains</strong> and <strong>onion routing</strong> would require a <strong>revolution</strong> in user <strong>interface design</strong> to have a <strong>chance</strong>; otherwise it will be a <strong>playground</strong> for the technology elite. In <strong>contrast</strong>, <strong>Dash</strong>'s "missing <strong>building</strong> blocks" are fundamentally simple. They can easily be used by <strong>people</strong> who don't have a <strong>unicorn</strong>'s <strong>worth</strong> of <strong>experience</strong> as <strong>web</strong> <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>security</strong> administrators. <strong>Dash</strong> writes about the <strong>demise</strong> of the <strong>View Source</strong> <strong>browser feature</strong>, which dispays the <strong>HTML</strong> from which the web page is built. View Source isn't dead, but it's sick. He's right that the <strong>web</strong> succeeded, in <strong>part</strong>, because <strong>people</strong> with little <strong>background</strong> could look at the <strong>source</strong> for the <strong>pages</strong> they liked, copy the <strong>code</strong> they wanted, and end up with something that looks pretty good. <strong>Today</strong>, you can no longer learn by copying; while <strong>View Source</strong> still exists on most <strong>browsers</strong>, the <strong>complexity</strong> of modern <strong>web</strong> pages have made it next to useless. The <strong>bits</strong> you want are wrapped in <strong>megabytes</strong> (literally) of <strong>JavaScript</strong> and CSS. But that doesn't have to be the end of the story. HTML can be functional without being complex. Most of what I write (including this <strong>piece</strong>) goes into a first <strong>draft</strong> as very simple <strong>HTML</strong>, using only a half-dozen tags. Simple editors for basic web content still exist. <strong>Dash</strong> <strong>points</strong> out that <strong><strong>Netscape</strong> Gold</strong> (the paid <strong>version</strong> of <strong>Netscape</strong>) had one, back in the <strong>day</strong>, and that there are many free <strong>editors</strong> for basic HTML. We'd have to talk ourselves out of the very complex <strong>formatting</strong> and <strong>layout</strong> that, after all, just gets in the way. <strong>Ask</strong> (almost) any <strong>designer</strong>: <strong>simplicity</strong> <strong>wins</strong>, not a drop-dead gorgeous page. We may have made <strong>View Source</strong> <strong>useless</strong>, but we haven't lost simplicity. And if we make enough <strong>simple</strong> <strong><strong>sites</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>sites</strong></strong> from which <strong>viewers</strong> can effectively copy useful <strong>code</strong>, View Source will become useful again, too. You can't become a web <strong>developer</strong> by viewing <strong>Facebook</strong>'s <strong>source</strong>; but you might by looking at a new <strong>site</strong> that isn't weighed down by all that <strong>CSS</strong> and JavaScript. The <strong>web</strong> was never supposed to be a few walled <strong>gardens</strong> of concentrated <strong>content</strong> owned by <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, and a few other major publishers. It was supposed to be a <strong>cacophony</strong> of different <strong>sites</strong> and voices. And it would be easy to rebuild this cacophony—indeed, it never really died. There are plenty of individual sites out there still, and they provide some (should I say most?) of the really valuable content on the web. The <strong>problem</strong> with the <strong>megasites</strong> is that they select and present "relevant" content to us. Much as we may complain about <strong>Facebook</strong>, selecting relevant <strong>content</strong> from an <strong>ocean</strong> of <strong>random</strong> <strong>sites</strong> is an important service. It's easy for me to imagine <strong>relatives</strong> and <strong>friends</strong> building their own <strong>sites</strong> for <strong>baby</strong> <strong>pictures</strong>, <strong>announcements</strong>, and general talk. That's what we did in the 90s. But would we go to the trouble of reading those all those sites? Probably not. I didn't in the 90s, and neither did you. We already have a tool for solving this problem. <strong>RSS</strong> lets websites provide "<strong>feeds</strong>" of <strong>news</strong> and new items. <strong>Applications</strong> like <strong>Feedly</strong> and <strong>Reeder</strong> let you build a <strong>collection</strong> of <strong>sites</strong> that <strong>interest</strong> you, and show you what's changed since the last time you visited. While I'd never check a <strong>dozen</strong> <strong>sites</strong> each <strong>day</strong>, I use Feedly to monitor <strong>hundreds</strong> of web<strong>sites</strong>. I would never check those <strong>sites</strong> by <strong>hand</strong>, but I scan Feedly every morning. And, unlike <strong>Facebook</strong>, Feedly doesn't know <strong>anything</strong> about its <strong>users</strong> except for the sites they read. Feedly has a decent user interface, though it could be a improved; it would have to be better to become popular with people who aren't technically literate. (Sorry.) Still, though, the <strong>UI</strong> <strong>gap</strong> for <strong>RSS</strong> is much smaller than for <strong>technologies</strong> like TOR. And if we're going to rebuild the net, we'll probably be better off choosing simple rather than bright, shiny, and complex technologies. <strong>Could</strong> <strong>someone</strong> build an <strong>RSS</strong> <strong>reader</strong> that made the <strong>web</strong> of independent <strong>sites</strong> as approachable as Facebook? I don't see why <strong>not—and</strong> <strong>users</strong> would have complete control over what they see. That's important; in a recent <strong>tweet</strong>, <strong>Dash</strong> says:
Google’s <strong>decision</strong> to kill <strong>Google Reader [</strong>their <strong>RSS</strong> client] was a turning <strong>point</strong> in enabling <strong>media</strong> to be manipulated by <strong>misinformation</strong> campaigns. The <strong>difference</strong> between <strong>individuals</strong> choosing the <strong>feeds</strong> they read and <strong>companies</strong> doing it for you affects all other <strong>forms</strong> of media. Yes, there would still be <strong>plenty</strong> of <strong><strong>sites</strong></strong> for every <strong>conspiracy theory</strong> and <strong>propaganda project</strong> around; but in a <strong>world</strong> where you choose what you see rather than letting a third <strong>party decide</strong> for you, these <strong><strong>sites</strong></strong> would have <strong>trouble</strong> gaining momentum. I don't want to underestimate the <strong>difficulty</strong> of this <strong>project</strong>, or overestimate its <strong>chances</strong> of success. We'd certainly have to get used to sites that aren't as glossy or complex as the ones we have now. We might have to revisit some of the most hideous <strong>bits</strong> of the <strong>first-generation web</strong>, including those awful GeoCities pages. We would probably need to avoid <strong>fancy</strong>, dynamic <strong><strong>web</strong>sites</strong>; and, before you think this will be easy, remember that one of the first <strong>extensions</strong> to the static <strong>web</strong> was CGI Perl. We would be taking the <strong>risk</strong> that we'd re-invent the same <strong>mistakes</strong> that brought us to our current mess. Simplicity is a discipline, and not an easy one. However, by losing <strong>tons</strong> of <strong>bloat</strong>, we'd end up with a web that is much faster and more responsive than what we have now. And maybe we'd learn to prize that speed and that responsiveness. We'd also need to avoid many of the <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong> <strong>flaws</strong> that were rampant in the early internet, and for which we're still paying. That technical debt came due a long time ago. Paying off that <strong>debt</strong> may require some complex <strong>technology</strong>, and some significant <strong>UI</strong> engineering. All too often, <strong>solutions</strong> to <strong>security</strong> <strong>problems</strong> make <strong>things</strong> more difficult for both <strong>users</strong> and attackers. <strong>Crowdflare</strong>'s new 1.1.1.1 <strong>service</strong> addresses some basic <strong>problems</strong> with our <strong><strong>DNS</strong></strong> <strong>infrastructure</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong>, and their <strong>CEO</strong> proposes some more basic <strong>changes</strong>, like <strong><strong>DNS</strong></strong> over HTTPS. But even simple <strong>changes</strong> like this <strong>require</strong> non-technical <strong>users</strong> to change <strong>configuration</strong> settings that they don't understand. This is where we really need the <strong>help</strong> of <strong>UX</strong> designers. We can't afford to make "safe" difficult. And we'd have to admit that our current <strong>web</strong>, with all its <strong>flaws</strong>, evolved from these simple <strong>building</strong> blocks. To some extent, then, it's what we wanted—or, perhaps, what we deserved. It's certainly what we accepted, and begs the question: "why wouldn't we accept the same thing again?" Starting over means little if we're destined to repeat the mistakes we've already made. So, we would need to develop and incorporate <strong>technology</strong> for preventing <strong>abuse</strong>; we would need to build a public <strong><strong>space</strong></strong> that really is a public <strong><strong>space</strong></strong>, not <strong>someone</strong> else's private <strong>property</strong>; and above all, we would need to divest <strong>ourselves</strong> of the arrogance that assumes "because we've built it, it is good." As <strong>Dash</strong> said six <strong>years</strong> ago, well before <strong>Facebook</strong>'s <strong>Very Bad Month</strong>, we would need to "take <strong>responsibility</strong> and accept blame." Regardless of how it happens, it's time to start thinking about rebuilding the web. That <strong>project</strong> is only likely to succeed if the <strong>rebuilt web</strong> is compatible with what we have <strong>today</strong>, including <strong>Facebook</strong> and YouTube. And it's only likely to succeed if it's simple enough for anyone to use. Anil Dash has outlined a way forward. It's not what I would have suggested, but it has a much higher chance of succeeding. Time to (re)build it. <strong>Continue</strong> reading It's <strong>time</strong> to rebuild the web.</body>
