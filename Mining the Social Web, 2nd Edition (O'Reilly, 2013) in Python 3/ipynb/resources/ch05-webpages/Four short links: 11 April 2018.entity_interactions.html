    <body><strong>Assignment</strong>, <strong>Warranties</strong>, <strong>Data</strong>, and <strong>Public Goods</strong>

Why <strong>Does</strong> "=" Mean <strong>Assignment</strong> -- marvellous history lesson. <strong>Warranty Void</strong> if Removed <strong>Stickers</strong> Are <strong>Bull</strong> -- <strong>Federal</strong> <strong>law</strong> says you can <strong>repair</strong> your own <strong>things</strong>, and <strong>manufacturers</strong> cannot force you to use their own <strong>repair</strong> services.

<strong>TXR</strong> -- a pattern <strong>language</strong> and a <strong>Lisp</strong> <strong>variant</strong> for data problems. <strong><strong>Roman</strong> Roads</strong> and <strong>Persistence Development</strong> -- In some <strong>ways</strong>, the <strong>emergence</strong> of the <strong>Roman</strong> <strong>road network</strong> is almost a natural <strong>experimentâ€”in light</strong> of the military <strong>purpose</strong> of the <strong>roads</strong>, the preferred <strong>straightness</strong> of their <strong><strong>construction</strong></strong>, and their <strong><strong>construction</strong></strong> in newly conquered and often undeveloped regions. This <strong>type</strong> of public good seems to have had a persistent <strong>influence</strong> on subsequent public good <strong>allocations</strong> and comparative development. At the same <strong>time</strong>, the <strong>abandonment</strong> of the <strong>wheel shock</strong> in <strong>MENA</strong> appears to have been powerful enough to cause that <strong>degree</strong> of persistence to break down. Overall, our <strong>analysis</strong> suggests that a public good <strong>provision</strong> is a powerful <strong>channel</strong> through which <strong>persistence</strong> in comparative development comes about. I wonder whether this <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>analysis</strong> is even conceivable with internet public <strong>policy</strong> like <strong>broadband</strong>, coding <strong>classes</strong>, and laws.
