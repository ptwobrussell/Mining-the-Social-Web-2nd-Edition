    <body><strong><strong>Database</strong> Attack</strong>, <strong>Death</strong> of <strong>Android Predicted</strong>, Predicting <strong>Recidivism</strong>, and <strong>Cybersecurity Law</strong> and Policy

Deep Dive: <strong><strong>Database</strong> Attack</strong>s -- I enjoyed the <strong>description</strong> of how this <strong>attack</strong> worked: using <strong>Postgres</strong> to write and run <strong>executables</strong>, smuggling in an executable that sets up a <strong>cryptocurrency mining operation</strong> on the machine. <strong>Yegge</strong> on <strong><strong>Android</strong></strong> (Steve <strong>Yegge</strong>) -- <strong>Remember</strong> that I said it could take 20 <strong>minutes</strong> to see a 1-line <strong>code change</strong> in the regular <strong><strong>Android</strong></strong> stack? That can happen in the biggest <strong><strong>apps</strong></strong> like <strong>Nest</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong>, but even for medium-size <strong><strong>apps</strong></strong> it can be two or three minutes. Whereas with React Native, it’s instantaneous. You make a change; you see the change. And that, <strong>folks</strong>, means you get to launch <strong>features</strong> 10x <strong>faster</strong>, which means <strong>faster</strong> <strong>time</strong> to <strong>market</strong>, which means first-mover advantage, which means you win, win, win. Abandoning native <strong>programming</strong> in <strong>favor</strong> of fast-cycle cross-platform <strong>frameworks</strong> like <strong>React Native</strong> is a winning strategy. <strong>Tim Bray</strong> disagrees with some of <strong>Yegge</strong>'s points. (Also: <strong>Yegge</strong>'s <strong>hiring</strong>, which is why he's blogging again)

The <strong>Accuracy</strong>, <strong>Fairness</strong>, and <strong>Limits</strong> of Predicting <strong>Recidivism</strong> -- We show, however, that the widely used commercial <strong>risk assessment software</strong> <strong>COMPAS</strong> is no more accurate or fair than <strong>predictions</strong> made by <strong>people</strong> with little or no criminal justice expertise. We further show that a simple linear <strong>predictor</strong> provided with only two <strong>features</strong> is nearly equivalent to COMPAS with its 137 <strong>features</strong>.

<strong>Teaching Cybersecurity Law</strong> and <strong>Policy</strong> -- My <strong>syllabus</strong> is much more than a one- or two-pager just listing the <strong>topics</strong> and weekly readings. Though there are a <strong>lot</strong> of reading <strong>assignments</strong>, the <strong>syllabus</strong> itself functions a <strong>bit</strong> like a <strong>casebook</strong> in that there also is a <strong>ton</strong> of narrative <strong>text</strong> framing each <strong>week</strong>’<strong>s topic</strong>, and also extensive <strong>questions</strong> for <strong>consideration</strong> matched to each reading. The full syllabus is 58 pages long. (via <strong>Bobby Chesney</strong>)
