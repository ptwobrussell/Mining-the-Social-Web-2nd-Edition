    <body>An <strong>introduction</strong> to how human <strong>senses</strong> can be incorporated into <strong>design</strong> principles. If a <strong>Tree Falls</strong> in the Forest…
BRAZIL BEGAN USING SATELLITE imaging to monitor deforestation during the 1980s. This was the first large-scale, coordinated <strong>response</strong> to <strong>loggers</strong> and <strong>ranchers</strong> who had been illegally clearing the <strong>rainforests</strong>, and it worked, for a time. To avoid being spotted, <strong>loggers</strong> and <strong>ranchers</strong> began working more discreetly in smaller <strong>areas</strong> that were harder to detect (see <strong>Figure</strong> 1-1).1 This required a new <strong>approach</strong> to monitoring the forests. Figure 1-1. A <strong>view</strong> powered by <strong><strong>Google Earth Engine</strong></strong> showing global <strong>deforestation</strong>

<strong><strong>Google Earth Engine</strong></strong> and the Brazilian <strong>NGO</strong>, <strong>Imazon</strong>, worked together to create more powerful environmental <strong>monitoring</strong> capabilities. Their <strong>collaboration</strong> identified and mapped a much <strong>wider range</strong> of <strong>deforestation</strong> in much greater detail. With new <strong>analysis</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> for satellite <strong>imagery</strong>, they were able to classify forest <strong>topologies</strong> within the rainforest. This improved the <strong>accuracy</strong> of regional <strong>assessments</strong>, both for their <strong>contribution</strong> to the surrounding <strong>ecosystem</strong> and their <strong>vulnerability</strong> to human damage. They monitored the <strong>emergence</strong> of unofficial <strong>roads</strong> that marked new human activity. They modeled the environmental <strong>risks</strong> posed by <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>logging</strong>, and ranching to protected <strong>areas</strong> of the Amazon. They were also able to project future <strong>scenarios</strong> to help plan a more effective <strong>management strategy</strong> that balanced human <strong>land use</strong> with forest <strong>preservation.Continue</strong> reading Returning to our senses.</body>
