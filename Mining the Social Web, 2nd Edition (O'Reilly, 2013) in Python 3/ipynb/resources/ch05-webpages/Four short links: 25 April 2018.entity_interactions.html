    <body><strong>Music Biz</strong>, <strong>Amazon DNS Hijack</strong>, <strong>Embedded Platform</strong>, and Tech Change

Music Industry's "Fantastic 2017" -- That $1.4 billion of <strong>growth</strong> puts the global <strong>total</strong> just below 2008 <strong>levels</strong> ($17.7 billion), meaning that the <strong>decline</strong> wrought through much of the last 10 years has been expunged. The recorded <strong>music business</strong> is locked firmly in <strong>growth mode</strong>, following nearly $1 billion growth in 2016. Cory <strong>Doctorow</strong> makes the <strong>point</strong> that while the "<strong>music industry</strong>" is booming, <strong>artist</strong> <strong>incomes</strong> aren't growing at the same rate. Or, indeed, at all. <strong>Amazon</strong>'s <strong>DNS Hijacked</strong> For Two <strong>Hours</strong> -- in <strong>service</strong> of raiding a cryptocurrency website. <strong>Nerves</strong> -- Pack your whole <strong>application</strong> into as little as 12MB and have it start in <strong>seconds</strong> by booting a lean cross-compiled <strong>Linux</strong> directly to the battle-hardened Erlang VM. Let <strong>Nerves</strong> take <strong>care</strong> of the <strong>network</strong>, <strong>discovery</strong>, <strong>I/O</strong>, <strong>firmware</strong> updates, and more. <strong>Focus</strong> on what <strong>matters</strong>, and have fun writing robust and maintainable software. <strong>Nifty</strong> <strong>approach</strong> to a very real problem. Five <strong>Things</strong> We Need to Know About Technological <strong>Change</strong> (Neil Postman) -- this is incredibly prescient and good. Technological <strong>change</strong> is not additive; it is ecological.<strong>[</strong>...] A new <strong>medium</strong> does not add <strong>something</strong>; it changes everything. In the <strong>year</strong> 1500, after the <strong>printing press</strong> was invented, you did not have old <strong>Europe</strong> plus the <strong>printing press</strong>. You had a different Europe. After <strong>television</strong>, <strong><strong>America</strong></strong> was not <strong><strong>America</strong></strong> plus <strong>television</strong>. <strong>Television</strong> gave a new <strong>coloration</strong> to every political <strong>campaign</strong>, to every <strong>home</strong>, to every <strong>school</strong>, to every <strong>church</strong>, to every industry, and so on. That is why we must be cautious about technological innovation. The consequences of technological change are always vast, often unpredictable, and largely irreversible. <strong>See</strong> also a related <strong>talk</strong> by Postman. (via <strong>Daniel G. Siegel</strong>)
