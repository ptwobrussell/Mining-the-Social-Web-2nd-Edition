    <body><strong>Data Literacy</strong>, <strong>Data Science Readings</strong>, <strong>Bloated Data Architectures</strong>, and AI Ruins Everything

Data Defenders -- <strong>game</strong> for grade 4-6 that teaches <strong>children</strong> and <strong>pre-teens</strong> the <strong>concept</strong> of personal <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> and its economic <strong>value</strong>, and introduces them to <strong>ways</strong> to manage and protect their personal <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> on the <strong>websites</strong> and apps they enjoy. (via <strong>BoingBoing</strong>)

<strong>Readings</strong> in <strong>Applied Data Science</strong> -- <strong>pointers</strong> to interesting <strong>papers</strong>, via <strong>Hadley Wickham</strong>'s <strong>Stanford</strong> class. <strong><strong>COST</strong></strong>: <strong>Configuration</strong> that Outperforms a <strong>Single Thread</strong> -- The <strong><strong>COST</strong></strong> of a given <strong><strong>platform</strong></strong> for a given <strong>problem</strong> is the <strong>hardware configuration</strong> required before the <strong><strong>platform</strong></strong> outperforms a competent single-threaded implementation. <strong>[</strong>...] We <strong>survey</strong> <strong>measurements</strong> of data-parallel <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> recently reported in <strong>SOSP</strong> and <strong>OSDI</strong>, and find that many <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> have either a surprisingly large <strong>COST</strong>, often <strong>hundreds</strong> of <strong>cores</strong>, or simply underperform one <strong>thread</strong> for all their reported configurations. Finding <strong>Alternative Musical Scales</strong> -- is there <strong>nothing</strong> that AI cannot improve/ruin? We search for alternative musical <strong><strong><strong>scale</strong>s</strong></strong> that <strong>share</strong> the main <strong>advantages</strong> of classical <strong><strong><strong>scale</strong>s</strong></strong>: <strong>pitch</strong> <strong>frequencies</strong> that bear simple <strong>ratios</strong> to each other, and multiple <strong>keys</strong> based on an underlying chromatic <strong>scale</strong> with tempered tuning. We conduct the <strong>search</strong> by formulating a <strong>constraint satisfaction problem</strong> that is well suited for <strong>solution</strong> by constraint programming. We find that certain 11-note <strong>scales</strong> on a 19-note chromatic <strong>stand</strong> out as superior to all others. These <strong><strong>scales</strong></strong> enjoy harmonic and structural <strong>possibilities</strong> that go significantly beyond what is available in classical <strong><strong>scales</strong></strong> and therefore provide a possible <strong>medium</strong> for innovative musical composition.
