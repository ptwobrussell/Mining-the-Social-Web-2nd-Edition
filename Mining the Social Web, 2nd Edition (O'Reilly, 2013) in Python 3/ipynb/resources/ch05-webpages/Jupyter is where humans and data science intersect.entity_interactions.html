    <body><strong>Discover</strong> how <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>-driven <strong>organizations</strong> are using <strong>Jupyter</strong> to analyze <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, <strong>share</strong> <strong>insights</strong>, and foster <strong>practices</strong> for dynamic, reproducible <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science.I</strong>'m grateful to join <strong>Fernando Pérez</strong> and <strong>Brian Granger</strong> as a <strong>program co-chair</strong> for <strong>Jupyter</strong>Con 2018. <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Jupyter</strong>, <strong>NumFOCUS</strong>, and <strong>O'Reilly Media</strong> will present the second annual <strong>Jupyter</strong>Con in New York City August 21–25, 2018. Timing for this event couldn't be better. The human <strong>side</strong> of <strong>data</strong> <strong>science</strong>, <strong>machine learning/AI</strong>, and scientific computing is more important than ever. This is seen in the broad <strong>adoption</strong> of <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong>-driven <strong>decision-making</strong> in human <strong>organizations</strong> of all <strong>kinds</strong>, the increasing <strong>importance</strong> of human centered <strong>design</strong> in <strong>tools</strong> for working with <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong>, the <strong>urgency</strong> for better <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong>insights</strong> in the <strong>face</strong> of complex socioeconomic <strong>conditions</strong> worldwide, as well as <strong>dialogue</strong> about the social <strong>issues</strong> these <strong>technologies</strong> bring to the <strong>fore</strong>: <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, <strong>ethics</strong>, <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>transparency</strong>, propaganda, etc. To paraphrase our <strong>co-chairs</strong>, <strong>Brian Granger</strong>:
<strong>Jupyter</strong> is where <strong>humans</strong> and <strong>data</strong> science intersect. And <strong>Fernando Perez</strong>:
The better the <strong>technology</strong>, the more important that human <strong>judgement</strong> becomes. Consequently, we'll explore three main <strong>themes</strong> at <strong>JupyterCon</strong> 2018:


Interactive <strong><strong><strong>computing</strong></strong></strong> with <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> at <strong>scale</strong>: the technical best <strong>practices</strong> and organizational <strong>challenges</strong> of supporting interactive <strong><strong><strong>computing</strong></strong></strong> in <strong>companies</strong>, <strong>universities</strong>, <strong>research</strong> <strong>collaborations</strong>, etc., (<strong>JupyterHub</strong>)

<strong>Extensible</strong> <strong>user</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> for <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong>, <strong>machine learning/AI</strong>, and scientific <strong><strong><strong>computing</strong></strong></strong> (<strong>JupyterLab</strong>)

<strong>Computational</strong> <strong>communication</strong>: taking the <strong>artifacts</strong> of interactive <strong><strong><strong>computing</strong></strong></strong> and communicating them to different <strong>audiences</strong>

A <strong>meta-theme</strong> that ties these together is extensible <strong>software architecture</strong> for interactive <strong><strong><strong>computing</strong></strong></strong> with <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>. <strong>Jupyter</strong> is built on a <strong>set</strong> of flexible, extensible, and re-usable <strong>building</strong> <strong>blocks</strong> that can be combined and assembled to address a wide <strong>range</strong> of usage cases. These <strong>building</strong> <strong>blocks</strong> are expressed through the various open <strong>protocols</strong>, <strong>APIs</strong>, and <strong>standards</strong> of Jupyter. The <strong>Jupyter</strong> <strong>community</strong> has much to discuss and <strong>share</strong> this year. For <strong>example</strong>, <strong>success</strong> <strong>stories</strong> such as the <strong>data science program</strong> at <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> illustrate the <strong>power</strong> of <strong>JupyterHub</strong> <strong>deployments</strong> at <strong>scale</strong> in <strong>education</strong>, <strong>research</strong>, and industry. As <strong>universities</strong> and <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>firms</strong> learn to handle the technical <strong><strong>challenges</strong></strong> of rolling out hands-on, interactive <strong>computing</strong> at <strong>scale</strong>, a <strong>cohort</strong> of organizational <strong><strong>challenges</strong></strong> come to the <strong>fore</strong>: <strong>practices</strong> regarding <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, <strong>compliance</strong>, <strong>data</strong> <strong>privacy</strong>, ethics, etc. These <strong>points</strong> are especially poignant in <strong>verticals</strong> such as <strong>health care</strong>, <strong>finance</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>, where the <strong>handling</strong> of sensitive <strong>data</strong> is rightly constrained by ethical and legal <strong>requirements</strong> (<strong>HIPAA</strong>, FERPA, etc.). Overall, this <strong>dialogue</strong> is extremely relevant—it is happening at the <strong>intersection</strong> of contemporary political and social <strong>issues</strong>, <strong>industry</strong> <strong>concerns</strong>, new <strong>laws</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>), the <strong>evolution</strong> of <strong>computation</strong>, plus good <strong>storytelling</strong> and <strong>communication</strong> in <strong>general—as</strong> we'll explore with <strong>practitioners</strong> throughout the conference. The recent <strong>beta release</strong> of <strong>JupyterLab</strong> embodies the <strong>meta-theme</strong> of extensible <strong>software architecture</strong> for interactive computing with data. While many <strong>people</strong> think of <strong>Jupyter</strong> as a "<strong>notebook</strong>," that's merely one <strong>building block</strong> needed for interactive computing with data. Other building <strong>blocks</strong> include <strong>terminals</strong>, <strong>file</strong> <strong>browsers</strong>, <strong>LaTeX</strong>, <strong>markdown</strong>, rich <strong>outputs</strong>, <strong>text</strong> <strong>editors</strong>, and <strong>renderers/viewers</strong> for different data formats. <strong>JupyterLab</strong> is the next-generation <strong>user interface</strong> for <strong>Project Jupyter</strong>, and provides these different <strong>building</strong> <strong>blocks</strong> in a flexible, configurable, customizable environment. This opens the <strong>door</strong> for <strong>Jupyter</strong> <strong>users</strong> to build <strong>custom</strong> <strong>workflows</strong>, and also for <strong>organizations</strong> to extend <strong>Jupyter</strong>Lab with their own <strong>custom</strong> functionality. <strong>Thousands</strong> of <strong>organizations</strong> require <strong>data</strong> <strong>infrastructure</strong> for <strong>reporting</strong>, sharing <strong>data</strong> insights, reproducing <strong>results</strong> of analytics, etc. Recent <strong>business studiesestimate</strong> that more than <strong>half</strong> of all <strong>companies</strong> globally are precluded from adopting <strong>AI</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> due to a <strong>lack</strong> of digital <strong>infrastructure—</strong> often because their <strong>efforts</strong> toward <strong>data</strong> and <strong>reporting infrastructure</strong> are buried in technical debt. So much of that <strong>infrastructure</strong> was built from <strong>scratch</strong>, even when <strong>organizations</strong> needed essentially the same <strong>building</strong> blocks. <strong>JupyterLab</strong>'s primary <strong>goal</strong> is to make it routine to build highly customized, interactive <strong>computing</strong> <strong>platforms</strong>, while supporting more than 90 different popular <strong>programming</strong> environments.

A third major <strong>theme</strong> <strong>builds</strong> on <strong>top</strong> of the other two: computational communication. For <strong>data</strong> and <strong>code</strong> to be useful for <strong>humans</strong>, who need to make <strong>decisions</strong>, it has to be embedded into a narrative—a <strong>story—</strong> that that can be communicated to others. <strong>Examples</strong> of this pattern <strong>include</strong>: <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>journalism</strong>, reproducible <strong><strong>research</strong></strong> and open <strong>science</strong>, computational <strong>narratives</strong>, open <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> in <strong>society</strong> and <strong>government</strong>, citizen <strong>science</strong>, and really any <strong>area</strong> of scientific <strong><strong>research</strong></strong> (<strong>physics</strong>, <strong>zoology</strong>, <strong>chemistry</strong>, astronomy, etc. ), plus the <strong>range</strong> of <strong>economics</strong>, <strong>finance</strong>, and econometric forecasting. Another growing <strong>segment</strong> of <strong>use</strong> <strong>cases</strong> involves <strong>Jupyter</strong> as a "last-mile" <strong>layer</strong> for leveraging <strong>AI</strong> <strong>resources</strong> in the cloud. This becomes especially important in <strong>light</strong> of new <strong>hardware</strong> emerging for <strong>AI</strong> <strong>needs</strong>, vying with competing <strong>demand</strong> from online <strong>gaming</strong>, virtual <strong>reality</strong>, cryptocurrency mining, etc. <strong>Please</strong> take the <strong>following</strong> as personal <strong>opinion</strong>, <strong>observations</strong>, <strong>perspectives</strong>: we've reached a <strong>point</strong> where <strong>hardware</strong> appears to be evolving more rapidly than <strong><strong>software</strong></strong>, while <strong><strong>software</strong></strong> appears to be evolving more rapidly than effective process. At <strong>O'Reilly Media</strong>, we work to map the emerging <strong>themes</strong> in <strong>industry</strong>, in a <strong>process</strong> nicknamed "radar." This <strong>perspective</strong> about <strong>hardware</strong> is a <strong>theme</strong> I've been mapping, and meanwhile comparing <strong>notes</strong> with <strong>industry</strong> experts. A few <strong>data</strong> <strong>points</strong> to consider: <strong>Jeff Dean</strong>'s <strong>talk</strong> at <strong>NIPS</strong> 2017, "<strong><strong>Machine Learning</strong></strong> for <strong><strong>Systems</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Systems</strong></strong> for <strong><strong>Machine Learning</strong></strong>" about <strong>comparisons</strong> of <strong>CPUs/GPUs/TPUs</strong>, and how <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> is transforming the <strong>design</strong> of <strong>computer <strong>hardware</strong></strong>; The <strong>Case</strong> for <strong>Learned Index Structures</strong>, also from <strong>Google</strong>, about the <strong>impact</strong> of "<strong>branch</strong> vs. <strong>multiple</strong>" <strong>costs</strong> on <strong>decades</strong> of <strong>data</strong>base theory; this <strong>podcast interview</strong> "<strong>Scaling</strong> <strong>machine</strong> learning" with <strong>Reza Zadeh</strong> about the critical <strong>importance</strong> of <strong><strong>hardware</strong>/software</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> in <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> <strong>apps</strong>; the <strong>video interview</strong> that <strong>Wes McKinney</strong> and I recorded at <strong>JupyterCon</strong> 2017 about how <strong>Apache Arrow</strong> presents a much different take on how to leverage <strong>hardware</strong> and distributed resources. The <strong<strong<strong>></strong><strong>></strong></strong<strong>></strong>notion</strong<strong<strong>></strong><strong>></strong></strong<strong>></strong> that "<strong<strong<strong>></strong><strong>></strong></strong<strong>></strong>hardware</strong<strong<strong>></strong><strong>></strong></strong<strong>></strong> <strong<strong>></strong><strong>></strong></strong<strong>></strong> <strong<strong>></strong>software</strong<strong>></strong> <strong<strong>></strong><strong>></strong></strong<strong>></strong> <strong>process</strong>" contradicts the past 15–20 <strong>years</strong> of <strong<strong>></strong>software</strong<strong>></strong> engineering practice. It's an inversion of the general assumptions we make. In <strong>response</strong>, <strong>industry</strong> will need to rework <strong>approaches</strong> for <strong>building software</strong> within the <strong>context</strong> of <strong><strong>AI</strong>—</strong> which was articulated succinctly by <strong>Lenny Pruss</strong> from <strong>Amplify</strong> <strong>Partners</strong> in "Infrastructure 3.0: <strong>Building</strong> <strong>blocks</strong> for the <strong>AI</strong> revolution." In this <strong>light</strong>, <strong>Jupyter</strong> provides an <strong>abstraction</strong> layer<strong>—</strong> a <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>buffer</strong> to help "future <strong>proof</strong>"<strong>—</strong> for complex <strong>use</strong> <strong>cases</strong> in <strong>NLP</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and related work. We're seeing this from most of the public <strong>cloud</strong> <strong>vendors</strong>, who are also <strong>leaders</strong> in <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong>, and who will be represented at the <strong>conference</strong> in August. Our <strong>program</strong> at <strong>JupyterCon</strong> will feature expert <strong>speakers</strong> across all of these themes. However, to me, that's merely the tip of the iceberg. So much of the real <strong>value</strong> that I get from <strong>conferences happens</strong> in the proverbial "<strong>Hallway Track</strong>," where you run into <strong>people</strong> who are riffing off <strong>news</strong> they've just learned in a <strong>session—</strong> perhaps in <strong>line</strong> with your <strong>thinking</strong>, perhaps in a completely different direction. Those <strong>conversations</strong> have <strong>space</strong> to flourish when <strong>people</strong> get immersed in the <strong>community</strong>, the <strong>issues</strong>, the possibilities. It'll be a busy week. We'll have two <strong>days</strong> of <strong>training</strong> <strong>courses</strong>: intensive, hands-on <strong>coding</strong>, a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>interaction</strong> with expert instructors. <strong>Training</strong> will overlap with one <strong>day</strong> of <strong>tutorials</strong>: led by <strong>experts</strong>, generally larger than <strong>training</strong> <strong>courses</strong> (though more detailed than <strong>session</strong> <strong>talks</strong>), featuring a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>Q</strong>&A. Then we'll have two <strong>days</strong> of <strong>keynotes</strong> and <strong>session</strong> <strong>talks</strong>, expo <strong>hall</strong>, <strong>lunches</strong> and sponsored <strong>breaks</strong>, plus <strong>Project Jupyter</strong> sponsored events. <strong>Events</strong> include <strong>Jupyter User Testing</strong>, <strong>author</strong> <strong>signings</strong>, "Meet the <strong>Experts</strong>" <strong>office</strong> <strong>hours</strong>, <strong>demos</strong> in the <strong>vendor expo hall—</strong> plus related <strong>meetups</strong> in the evenings. Last <strong>year</strong>, the <strong>Poster Session</strong> was one of the biggest <strong>surprises</strong> to me: it was such a <strong>hit</strong> that it was difficult to move through the <strong>room</strong>; <strong>walkways</strong> were packed with <strong>people</strong> asking <strong>presenters questions</strong> about their projects. This <strong>year</strong>, we'll introduce a <strong>Business Summit</strong>, similar to the popular <strong>summits</strong> at the <strong>Strata Data Conferences</strong> and The AI Conference. This will include high-level <strong>presentations</strong> on the most promising and important <strong>developments</strong> in <strong>Jupyter</strong> for <strong>executives</strong> and decision-makers. <strong>Brian Granger</strong> and I will be hosting the <strong>Business Summit</strong>, along with <strong>Joel Horwitz</strong> of IBM. One interesting <strong>data</strong> <strong>point</strong>: among the regional <strong>events</strong>, we've seen much more <strong>engagement</strong> this <strong>year</strong> from <strong>enterprise</strong> and <strong>government</strong> than we'd expected, more <strong>emphasis</strong> on <strong>business use</strong> <strong>cases</strong> and new <strong>product</strong> launches. The ecosystem is growing, and will be represented well at JupyterCon! We will also feature an <strong>Education Track</strong> in the main <strong>conference</strong>, expanding on the well-attended <strong>Education Birds-of-a-Feather</strong> and related <strong>talks</strong> during JupyterCon 2017. <strong>Use</strong> of <strong>Jupyter</strong> in <strong>education</strong> has grown rapidly across many <strong>contexts</strong>: <strong>middle/high-school</strong>, <strong>universities</strong>, corporate <strong>training</strong>, and <strong>online</strong> courses. <strong>Lorena Barba</strong> and <strong>Robert Talbert</strong> will be organizing this track. Following our <strong>schedule</strong> of <strong>conference</strong> <strong>talks</strong>, the <strong>week</strong> wraps up with a <strong>community sprint day</strong> on Saturday. You can <strong>work</strong> side-by-side with <strong>leaders</strong> and <strong>contributors</strong> in the <strong><strong>Jupyter</strong></strong> <strong>ecosystem</strong> to implement that <strong>feature</strong> you've always wanted, fix <strong>bugs</strong>, <strong>work</strong> on <strong>design</strong>, write <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>test software</strong>, or dive <strong>deep</strong> into the <strong>internals</strong> of <strong>something</strong> in the <strong><strong>Jupyter</strong></strong> <strong>ecosystem</strong>. Be sure to bring your laptop. <strong>Note</strong> that we believe true <strong>innovation</strong> depends on hearing from, and listening to, <strong>people</strong> with a <strong>variety</strong> of perspectives. <strong>Please</strong> read our <strong>Diversity Statement</strong> for more details. Also, we're committed to creating a safe and productive <strong>environment</strong> for <strong>everyone</strong> at all of our events. <strong>Please</strong> read our <strong>Code</strong> of Conduct. Last <strong>year</strong>, we were able to work with the <strong>community</strong> plus matching <strong>donations</strong> to provide several "<strong>Diversity</strong> & <strong>Inclusion</strong>" <strong>scholarships</strong>, as well as more than <strong>dozen student</strong> <strong>scholarships</strong>. We're looking forward to building on that this year! That's a <strong>sample</strong> of what's coming up for <strong>JupyterCon</strong> in <strong>NYC</strong> this August. In <strong>preparation</strong> for the <strong>event</strong>, we'll also help <strong>present</strong> and sponsor a regional <strong>community</strong> <strong>event</strong>—check out <strong>Jupyter Pop-up DC</strong>, May 15, 2018. We look forward to many <strong>opportunities</strong> to showcase new <strong>work</strong> and <strong>ideas</strong>, to meet each other, to learn about the <strong>architecture</strong> of the <strong>project</strong> itself, and to contribute to the <strong>future</strong> of Jupyter. <strong>Continue</strong> reading <strong>Jupyter</strong> is where <strong>humans</strong> and <strong>data</strong> science intersect.</body>
