    <body>Our <strong>survey</strong> reveals how <strong>organizations</strong> are using <strong>tools</strong>, <strong>techniques</strong>, and training to apply <strong>AI</strong> through deep learning. We’re at an exciting <strong>point</strong> with artificial <strong>intelligence</strong> (AI). <strong>Years</strong> of <strong>research</strong> are yielding tangible <strong>results</strong>, specifically in the <strong>area</strong> of deep learning. <strong>New</strong> <strong>projects</strong> and related technologies are blossoming. Enthusiasm is high. Yet the <strong>path</strong> toward real and practical <strong>application</strong> of <strong>AI</strong> and deep <strong>learning</strong> remains unclear for many organizations. <strong>Business</strong> and <strong>technology</strong> <strong>leaders</strong> are searching for clarity. Where do I start? How can I train my teams to perform this work? How do I avoid the pitfalls? We conducted a <strong>survey</strong>[1<strong>]</strong> to help <strong>leaders</strong> better understand how <strong>organizations</strong> are applying <strong>AI</strong> through deep <strong>learning</strong> and where they’re encountering the biggest obstacles. We identified four notable <strong>survey</strong> <strong>findings</strong> that apply to organizations. 1. There<strong>’</strong>s an <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> <strong><strong>skills</strong></strong> <strong><strong>gap</strong></strong>
Of particular <strong>note</strong> is an <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> <strong><strong>skills</strong></strong> <strong><strong>gap</strong></strong> revealed in the survey. 28<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> of <strong>respondents</strong> are using deep <strong>learning</strong> now and 54<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> say it will play a key <strong>role</strong> in their future projects. Who will do this work? <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> <strong>talent</strong> is scarce, and the <strong>increase</strong> in <strong><strong>AI</strong></strong> <strong>projects</strong> means the <strong>talent</strong> pool will likely get smaller in the near future. 2. <s<strong>t</strong>rong>Companies</s<strong>t</strong>rong> are addressing <strong>t</strong>he <s<strong>t</strong>rong>AI</s<strong>t</strong>rong> <s<strong>t</strong>rong>skills</s<strong>t</strong>rong> gap <strong>t</strong>hrough <s<strong>t</strong>rong><strong>t</strong>raining</s<strong>t</strong>rong>

So, it’s no <strong>surprise</strong> that the main <strong>factor</strong> holding <strong>companies</strong> back from trying deep <strong>learning</strong> is the <strong>skills</strong> gap. To overcome this <strong>gap</strong>, a <strong>majority</strong> (75<strong>%</strong>) of <strong>respondents</strong> said their <strong>company</strong> is using some <strong>form</strong> of <strong>in-house</strong> or external training program. Almost <strong>half</strong> (49<strong><strong>%</strong></strong>) of <strong>respondents</strong> said their <strong><strong>company</strong></strong> offered “in-house on-the-job <strong><strong><strong>training</strong></strong>.</strong>” 35<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> indicated their <strong><strong>company</strong></strong> used either formal <strong><strong>training</strong></strong> from a third <strong>party</strong> or from individual <strong><strong>training</strong></strong> <strong>consultants</strong> or contractors. 3. Initial deep <strong><strong>learning</strong></strong> <strong>projects</strong> often focus on safe upgrades
The <strong>rise</strong> of deep <strong><strong>learning</strong></strong> can be traced to its <strong>success</strong> in <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>speech</strong> <strong>technologies</strong>, and <strong>game playing</strong>, but our <strong>survey</strong> shows <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>data scientists</strong> are more likely to use it to work with structured or semistructured data. Why? There are good reasons. Upgrading familiar <strong>applications</strong> with deep <strong>learning</strong> is a <strong>safer investment</strong> than starting <strong>something</strong> new, <strong><strong>businesses</strong></strong> have a <strong>lot</strong> of structured and semistructured <strong>data</strong> already, and the <strong>number</strong> of <strong><strong>businesses</strong></strong> that can currently make <strong>use</strong> of <strong>computer vision</strong> (to say nothing of gaming) is limited. That said, our <strong>respondents</strong> see <strong>value</strong> in <strong><strong>vision</strong> technology</strong>, and new deep <strong>learning</strong> <strong>applications</strong> for <strong>vision</strong> will grow in <strong>tandem</strong> with <strong>text</strong> and semistructured data. 4. <strong>TensorFlow</strong> is the most popular deep learning <strong>tool</strong>
Most <strong>respondents</strong> (73<strong>%</strong>) said they’ve begun playing with deep learning software. <strong>TensorFlow</strong> is by far the most popular <strong>tool</strong> among our <strong>respondents</strong>, with <strong>Keras</strong> in second <strong>place</strong>, and PyTorch in third. Other <strong>frameworks</strong> like <strong>MXNet</strong>, <strong>CNTK</strong>, and <strong>BigDL</strong> have growing audiences as well. We expect all of these frameworks—including those that are less popular <strong>now—to continue</strong> to add <strong><strong>use</strong>rs</strong> and <strong>use</strong> cases.

We'll also explore these and related <strong>AI</strong> <strong>topics</strong> at <strong>Artificial Intelligence Conference</strong> in <strong>New York</strong>, April 29-May 2, 2018. [1<strong>]</strong> In early 2018 we conducted a <strong>survey</strong> of <strong>subscribers</strong> to our <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>data</strong>, and programming <strong>newsletters</strong> and received more than 3,300 responses. We focused on deep <strong>learning</strong> and assessed the <strong>adoption</strong> of <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong> needed to build <strong>AI</strong> applications. <strong>Continue</strong> reading 4 <strong>things</strong> <strong>business</strong> <strong>leaders</strong> should know as they explore <strong>AI</strong> and deep learning.</body>
