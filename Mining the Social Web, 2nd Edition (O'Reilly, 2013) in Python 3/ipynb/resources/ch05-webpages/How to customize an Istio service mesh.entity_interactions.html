    <body><strong>Choose</strong> an <strong>Istio</strong> <strong>sidecar</strong> for <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>observability</strong>, and security.Even though <strong>service</strong> <strong>meshes</strong> provide <strong>value</strong> outside of the <strong>use</strong> of micro<strong>service</strong>s and <strong>containers</strong>, it's in these <strong>environments</strong> that many <strong>teams</strong> first consider using a <strong>service</strong> mesh. The <strong>sheer volume</strong> of <strong>services</strong> that must be managed on an <strong>individual</strong>, distributed <strong>basis</strong> with micro<strong>services</strong> (<strong>versus</strong> centrally for a <strong>monolith</strong>) creates <strong>challenges</strong> for ensuring <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>observability</strong>, and <strong>security</strong> of these <strong>services</strong>. <strong>Adoption</strong> of a <strong>container orchestrator</strong> addresses a <strong>layer</strong> of <strong>infrastructure</strong> <strong>needs</strong>, but leaves some <strong>application</strong> or service-level <strong>needs</strong> unmet. Rather than attempting to overcome distributed <strong>systems concerns</strong> by writing <strong>infrastructure logic</strong> into <strong>application code</strong>, some <strong>teams</strong> choose to manage these <strong>challenges</strong> with a service mesh. A <strong>service mesh</strong> can help by ensuring the <strong>responsibility</strong> of <strong>service management</strong> is centralized, avoiding redundant <strong>instrumentation</strong>, and making <strong>observability</strong> ubiquitous and uniform <strong>across</strong> services. Choosing a <strong><strong>service</strong></strong> mesh
<strong>Factors</strong> such as your <strong>teams</strong>’ operational and <strong>technology expertise</strong>, existing <strong>observability</strong>, and <strong>access control tooling</strong> will influence the <strong><strong>service</strong></strong> mesh <strong>components</strong>, <strong>adapters</strong>, and deployment model you choose. Among <strong>others</strong>, <strong>Istio</strong> is a popularly adopted, open source service mesh. Some choose <strong>Istio</strong> (or any <strong><strong>service</strong> mesh</strong>) for the automatic and immediate <strong>visibility</strong> it provides into top-line <strong>service</strong> metrics. In <strong>fact</strong>, many become hooked on <strong>service</strong> <strong>meshes</strong> for the observability they provide alone. As a <strong>microservices</strong> <strong>platform</strong>, <strong>Istio</strong> is extensible through the <strong>way</strong> in which it offers <strong>choice</strong> of <strong>adapters</strong> and sidecars. <strong>Istio</strong> <strong>envelops</strong> and <strong>integrates</strong> with other open <strong>source</strong> <strong>projects</strong> to deliver a full-service <strong>mesh</strong>, which both <strong>bolsters</strong> its <strong>set</strong> of <strong>capabilities</strong> and offers a <strong>choice</strong> of which specific <strong>projects</strong> are included and deployed. <strong>Whether</strong> through <strong>Mixer</strong> <strong>adapters</strong> for <strong>observability</strong> or through swapping <strong>sidecars</strong>, <strong>Istio</strong> allows you to choose which <strong>components</strong> to include in your deployment. Customizing an <strong>Istio</strong> <strong>service mesh</strong>
There are multiple deployment <strong>models</strong> you can use to lay down a <strong>service mesh</strong>. One of the most popular <strong>options</strong> is to deploy your <strong>service</strong> <strong>proxies</strong> as sidecars. Sidecarring your <strong>service proxy</strong> offers <strong>benefits</strong> like fine-grained <strong>policy enforcement</strong> and intra-cluster service-to-service encryption. This <strong>deployment <strong>model</strong></strong> is the <strong>model</strong> of <strong>choice</strong> for Istio. Other <strong>Istio</strong> <strong>deployment</strong> <strong>choices</strong> include:


Mixer <strong>adapters</strong>: typically used for integrating with <strong>access control</strong>, <strong>telemetry</strong>, quota <strong>enforcement</strong>, and billing systems. <strong>Service</strong> <strong>proxies</strong>: abstract the <strong>network</strong>, translating <strong>requests</strong> between a <strong>client</strong> and service. Though <strong>Envoy</strong> is the <strong>default <strong>service proxy</strong> sidecar</strong>, you may choose another <strong>service proxy</strong> for your sidecar. While there are multiple <strong>service</strong> <strong>proxies</strong> in the <strong>ecosystem</strong>, outside of <strong>Envoy</strong>, only two have currently demonstrated <strong>integration</strong> with <strong>Istio</strong>: <strong>Linkerd</strong> and NGINX. The <strong>arrival</strong> of <strong>choice</strong> in <strong>service</strong> <strong>proxies</strong> for <strong>Istio</strong> has generated a <strong>lot</strong> of excitement. Linkerd’s <strong>integration</strong> was created early in Istio’s 0.1.6 release. Similarly, the <strong>nginMesh project</strong> has drawn much <strong>interest</strong> in the <strong>use</strong> of <strong>NGINX</strong> as Istio’<strong>s service proxy</strong>, as many <strong>organizations</strong> have broad and deep operational <strong>expertise</strong> built around this battle-tested proxy. <strong>Learn</strong> more about how to deploy your <strong>sidecar</strong> (<strong>Istio</strong> <strong>proxy</strong>) of <strong>choice</strong> in the free <strong>webcast</strong> "<strong>Istio</strong>—The extensible service mesh."
