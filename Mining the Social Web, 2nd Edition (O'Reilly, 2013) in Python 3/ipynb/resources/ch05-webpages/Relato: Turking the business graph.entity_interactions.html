    <body>A failed <strong>analytics</strong> startup post-mortem.In <strong>order</strong> to conquer a market, you must first understand it. We often speak of <strong>markets</strong> in the <strong>abstract</strong>, as addressable <strong>segments</strong> of the <strong>economy</strong>, defining them by <strong>examples</strong> of <strong>companies</strong> and by <strong>comparisons</strong> to <strong>others</strong> engaged in similar activities. <strong>Sales</strong> and <strong>marketing</strong> <strong>leaders</strong> have richer internal <strong>models</strong> of <strong>markets</strong> they use to guide their <strong>organizations</strong> as they fight for their <strong>share</strong> of the <strong>markets</strong> they contest. In <strong>January</strong> 2015, I set out to build an external <strong>representation</strong> of a <strong>market</strong> every <strong>bit</strong> as rich as those in the <strong>minds</strong> of leading <strong>executives</strong> driving successful <strong>companies</strong>; I founded an <strong>analytics</strong> <strong>startup</strong> called <strong>Relato—a</strong> <strong>startup</strong> that, unfortunately, did not succeed. In this <strong>post</strong>, I’ll present the <strong>story</strong> of the <strong>company</strong> and the <strong><strong>work</strong></strong> I did there, the <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> and net<strong><strong>work</strong></strong> science involved in my <strong><strong>work</strong></strong>, and some <strong>insight</strong> into how not to run a young <strong>analytics</strong> startup, and a little about how to do so as well. My <strong>mission</strong> with <strong>Relato</strong> was to build a deeper <strong>understanding</strong> of the modern <strong>network</strong>ed <strong>economy</strong>, a vast <strong>network</strong> in which <strong>companies</strong> are best defined according to their <strong>business</strong> <strong>relationships</strong> with other <strong>companies</strong>. When it comes to understanding <strong>companies</strong>, it’s <strong>“</strong>who you know.” These <strong>relationships</strong> translate to <strong><strong>connections</strong></strong> in the <strong>business graph</strong>, made up of <strong><strong>connections</strong></strong> between <strong>customer</strong>, <strong>partner</strong>, <strong>competitor</strong>, and investor. <strong>Mission</strong>: <strong>Mapping</strong> <strong>markets</strong>
I started <strong>Relato</strong> with an <strong>experiment</strong> to see how much <strong>market intelligence</strong> I could gather from the business web. Having worked at LinkedIn, I missed their social graph. I wondered, “Could a <strong>copy</strong> of the <strong>business graph</strong> be collected from the open <strong>web</strong>?” The <strong>answer</strong> to that <strong>research question</strong> is what led me to found Relato. I started by surveying the <strong>state</strong> of the <strong>market</strong> for <strong>data</strong> on companies. I discovered that while basic firmographic <strong>data</strong> was <strong>available—things</strong> like <strong>address</strong>, <strong>industry code</strong>, website technologies—there was <strong>nothing</strong> that captured the actual <strong>business activity</strong> of companies. By <strong>contrast</strong>, when I surveyed the <strong>websites</strong> of <strong><strong>business</strong>es</strong>, I found a <strong>treasure trove</strong> of <strong>information</strong> about their <strong>business</strong> <strong>relationships</strong> with other companies. Starting with a <strong>market</strong> I knew—big data—I manually transcribed the <strong>partnership</strong> <strong>pages</strong> of the major <strong>players</strong>: <strong>Hortonworks</strong>, <strong>Cloudera</strong>, <strong>MapR</strong>, and Pivotal. The combined <strong>list</strong> came to <strong>hundreds</strong> of <strong>companies—not</strong> a bad <strong>survey</strong> of the big data market. Figure 1. Where it all started: Hortonworks’ partnership page. Screenshot by Russell Jurney. I saw opportunity! I could transcribe the <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> listed on <strong>partnership</strong> <strong>pages</strong> to learn how <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> actually did business. Then I could use graph <strong>analytics</strong> on this <strong>data</strong> to extract next-generation <strong>profiles</strong> on companies. This <strong>data</strong> could be used in lead <strong>scoring</strong> and lead <strong>generation</strong> <strong>systems</strong> to provide a <strong>breakthrough</strong> in their <strong>level</strong> of performance. In short, I could provide <strong>leads</strong> for <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>customers</strong> that would convert to <strong>sales</strong> at a rate never before seen! I got excited. What if <strong>sales</strong> calls only came to <strong>people</strong> who wanted your <strong>product</strong>, because Relato told you so? I could optimize the economy and change the world! I was inspired. I figured out roughly how I could collect this <strong>data</strong> using natural <strong>language processing</strong>, an <strong>area</strong> that I know a little <strong>bit</strong> about but is not one of my <strong>core</strong> skills. Building this model and making it good enough to be saleable would take at least a year. I did not have a <strong>year</strong> of <strong>cash</strong> to burn in the bank. Fortunately, there was a faster alternative. There was a <strong>shift</strong> in “big <strong>data</strong><strong>”</strong> to hybrid <strong>human/<strong>machine</strong> processing</strong>, where <strong>humans</strong> located in <strong>places</strong> where <strong>wages</strong> are low would perform many <strong>instances</strong> of simple <strong>tasks</strong> to cheaply create <strong>data</strong> sets for <strong>machine</strong> learning systems. Using this <strong>method</strong>, there would ultimately be a higher <strong><strong>cost</strong></strong> per <strong>record</strong> collected because I would be paying real <strong>humans wages</strong>, but the up-front <strong><strong>cost</strong></strong> in development time was much lower. This <strong>way</strong>, I could get started much faster, shipping a beta <strong>product</strong> to <strong>customers</strong> using <strong>money</strong> from angel <strong>investors</strong> instead of <strong>venture</strong> capitalists.

Most <strong><strong>data</strong> scientists</strong> use <strong>application programing</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>) like Amazon’s <strong>Mechanical Turk</strong> to automate delegating <strong>data</strong> processing <strong>tasks</strong> to humans. Rather than using an <strong>API</strong>, I built a <strong>data collection web application</strong> that was used by <strong>people</strong> I actually got to know: “mechanical Turks” I hired on a <strong>website</strong> called UpWork. They would transcribe <strong>partnership</strong> <strong>pages</strong> and enter them into a <strong>database</strong> using an <strong>application</strong> that did <strong>things</strong> like autocomplete <strong>company</strong> names to ensure the data was clean and consistent. If the <strong>page</strong> had <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong>partnerships</strong>, I automated the <strong>collection process</strong> using <strong>utilities</strong> I developed to extract the <strong>names</strong> and <strong>domains</strong> of companies. The <strong>system</strong> worked beautifully, and the <strong>workers</strong> became good at their jobs. I would spot check their work, offering corrections. Instead, they often corrected me! There is truly a <strong>wealth</strong> of <strong>talent</strong> available from underemployed <strong>individuals</strong> in <strong>areas</strong> of the <strong>world</strong> with less <strong>opportunity</strong> than we enjoy in the Bay Area. They are talented and hardworking, and you can get great <strong>work humanely—if</strong> you treat them with the <strong>respect</strong> they deserve—rather than as human <strong>computers</strong> at the other <strong>end</strong> of an API. Figure 3. The <strong>Relato</strong> <strong>data</strong> collection system. Image by Russell Jurney. <strong>Data</strong> in <strong>hand</strong>, I developed algorithms using a <strong>graph database</strong> to calculate <strong>metrics</strong> describing the <strong>way</strong> companies worked together. I started by basing Relato’s <strong>lead</strong> scoring <strong>system</strong> on <strong>data</strong> from several commercial <strong>APIs</strong> to ensure my <strong>model</strong> had <strong>everything</strong> my competitors used. Then I added to the <strong>model</strong> the <strong>features</strong> I derived from the partnership graph. It worked! The accuracy of the model increased dramatically. I knew I was on to <strong>something</strong> when the <strong>model</strong> indicated that the <strong>partnership centrality</strong>, a <strong>graph</strong> metric, was by far the most important <strong>feature</strong> determining lead scoring accuracy. It was even more important than the 650-area <strong>code</strong> (<strong>Silicon Valley</strong>) for a <strong>company</strong> selling to <strong>technology</strong> startups! Relato was off to a good start, algorithmically at least. This became a <strong>slide</strong> in our <strong>pitch deck</strong> (see Figure 4). Figure 4.

Lead <strong>generation</strong>: <strong>Minting</strong> hot <strong>leads</strong>
<strong>Relato</strong> built two <strong>things</strong>: a lead <strong>generation</strong> system for <strong>B2B</strong> <strong>sales</strong>, and <strong>MarketMaps</strong>, a business graph visualization tool. A <strong>lead scoring system</strong> is just a predictive <strong>model</strong> for <strong>inbound business</strong> <strong>contacts</strong>, scoring them by how likely they are to become customers. A lead <strong>generation <strong>system</strong></strong> adds a <strong><strong>data</strong>base</strong> already populated with a “universe<strong>”</strong> full of <strong>contacts</strong>, plus a <strong>lot</strong> of plumbing to shuffle the <strong>data</strong> through the <strong>system</strong>, through the <strong>algorithms</strong> and back out to the customer. In goes a current customer list, out go recommended leads. The <strong>idea</strong> of algorithmic <strong>lead generation</strong> is to take a <strong>database</strong> of <strong><strong>business</strong></strong> <strong>contacts</strong> representing the entire <strong>world</strong> of <strong><strong>business</strong></strong> and select those few “hot <strong>leads</strong>” for a specific <strong>company</strong> that will convert into real customers. In the <strong>process</strong>, this generates a <strong>ton</strong> of value. If you can pull this <strong>off</strong>, it’s a good <strong>business model—see</strong> <strong>Figure</strong> 5, which describes the <strong>price amplification</strong> as <strong>contacts</strong> travel through the <strong>marketing funnel</strong> on their <strong>way</strong> to becoming sales. <strong>Contacts</strong> sell for a <strong>fraction</strong> of a dollar. Good leads sell for $50 to as much as $500. That makes a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>room</strong> for profit! Figure 5. Minting <strong>leads</strong> and <strong>dollars</strong> using <strong>graph</strong> analytics. Image by Russell Jurney. <strong>Figure</strong> 6 shows the <strong>marketing funnel</strong> itself for a <strong>business-to-business</strong> (<strong>B2B</strong>) <strong>company</strong> with a $4 million marketing budget. At the <strong>top</strong> of the <strong>funnel</strong>, <strong>contacts</strong> for a <strong>person sell</strong> for a <strong>fraction</strong> of a dollar. The <strong>sale</strong> of lead <strong>lists</strong> is still a thriving <strong>market</strong>, although the <strong>accuracy</strong> of the <strong>contact information</strong> varies greatly. It takes many <strong>leads</strong> in the <strong>top</strong> of the <strong>funnel</strong> to result in one <strong>sale</strong> at the bottom. In this <strong>case</strong>, we’ll need 80,000 <strong>responses</strong> from <strong>contacts</strong> to meet our revenue goal. A <strong>response</strong> would be opening or clicking on a <strong>link</strong> in an <strong>email</strong> or coming to the <strong>website</strong> from a web search. Figure 6. A <strong><strong>B2B</strong></strong> <strong><strong>sales</strong></strong> and <strong>marketing funnel</strong> for a <strong><strong>B2B</strong></strong> <strong>company</strong> with a <strong><strong>sales</strong></strong> <strong>goal</strong> of $10 million, a <strong>marketing budget</strong> of $4 million and a sale price of $100K. Image by Russell Jurney. The next <strong>step</strong> in the <strong>funnel</strong> is a <strong>marketing</strong> qualified <strong>lead</strong> (MQL). A <strong><strong><strong>lead</strong></strong></strong> becomes an <strong>MQL</strong> when an <strong>analysis</strong> of the <strong><strong><strong>lead</strong></strong></strong><strong>’</strong>s behavior <strong>determines</strong> the <strong><strong><strong>lead</strong></strong></strong> is likely enough to buy that they merit <strong>attention</strong> from a real person. <strong>MQLs</strong> for <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>companies</strong> go for about $50 a piece. <strong>Marketo</strong> and other <strong>marketing automation</strong> <strong>systems</strong> calculate a <strong>lead score</strong> based on a lead<strong>’</strong>s <strong>behavior</strong>, such as when they interact with your <strong>website</strong> (10 points!) or download a white paper (50 points!). When the <strong>score</strong> becomes high enough, <strong>contact</strong> is made by a lead qualifier. A <strong>lead qualifier</strong> is a junior <strong>salesperson</strong> who makes initial <strong>sales contacts</strong> by <strong>phone</strong> and email. The <strong>problem</strong> with marketing <strong>automation</strong> <strong>systems</strong> is that the scoring algorithm is usually arbitrary. As a <strong>result</strong>, there is widespread <strong>dissatisfaction</strong> in the <strong>result</strong>s generated by the large <strong>investments enterprises</strong> have made in marketing <strong>automation</strong> over the last decade. This is what drives the lead scoring market. Predictive <strong><strong>lead</strong></strong> scoring <strong>systems</strong> substitute <strong>machine</strong> learning for manual behavioral <strong>analysis</strong> to optimize the <strong><strong>lead</strong></strong> scoring algorithm. They replace arbitrary <strong>lead</strong> <strong>scores</strong> with artificial intelligence. Lead scoring <strong>systems</strong> then become a black <strong>box</strong> within the <strong>marketing funnel</strong> that uses past <strong>results</strong> (<strong>sales</strong>) to score future leads. <strong>Firmographic</strong> <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> or <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> characterizing a <strong>business</strong> is limited, so behavior is the primary <strong>training</strong> <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> for these <strong>systems</strong>, which work better than marketing automation alone. These <strong>systems</strong> have return on <strong>investment</strong> (<strong>ROI</strong>), but so far, this has turned out to be an iterative <strong>improvement</strong> that has not revolutionized <strong>sales</strong> and marketing. The next <strong>step</strong> in the <strong>marketing funnel</strong> is a <strong>sales</strong> qualified <strong>lead</strong> (SQL). A <strong><strong>lead</strong></strong> becomes an <strong>SQL</strong> when a live, in-<strong>person</strong> <strong>sales<strong>person</strong></strong> has spoken to the <strong>person</strong> behind the potential <strong><strong>lead</strong></strong>, and through <strong>conversation</strong> has determined they are a good <strong>fit</strong> for the <strong>company</strong><strong>’</strong>s product. Top <strong><strong>salespeople</strong></strong> are fed <strong>SQLs</strong> from junior <strong><strong>salespeople</strong></strong> and they use their extensive <strong>skills</strong> to build <strong>relationships</strong> and close deals. The <strong>lead funnel</strong> has side <strong>branches</strong>: a good senior <strong>salesperson</strong> will also do his or her own <strong>lead generation</strong>, often bringing a <strong>rolodex</strong> from <strong><strong>job</strong></strong> to <strong><strong>job</strong></strong>, selling different <strong>products</strong> to the same contacts over and over. For <strong>B2B</strong> <strong><strong>sales</strong></strong>, it is necessary to pour a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>contacts</strong> (200 in our <strong>slide</strong> in <strong>Figure</strong> 6) into the <strong><strong>sales</strong></strong> and <strong>marketing funnel</strong> to generate a single sale. Most <strong>leads</strong> fail to mature to the next <strong><strong>level</strong></strong> at each <strong><strong>level</strong></strong> of the funnel. Relato’s <strong>mission</strong> was am<strong>bit</strong>ious: to skip <strong>levels</strong> in the <strong><strong>sales</strong></strong> and <strong>marketing funnel</strong>, in <strong>order</strong> to mint <strong>contacts</strong> directly into <strong>leads</strong> every <strong>bit</strong> as good as <strong><strong>sales</strong></strong> qualified <strong>leads</strong>. Many other lead <strong>generation</strong> <strong>companies</strong> have attempted this <strong>task</strong>, but <strong>none</strong> that I could find used <strong>anything</strong> like Relato’s business graph to do so. In the next <strong>post</strong>, we’ll <strong>talk</strong> more about the <strong>products</strong> I built at <strong>Relato</strong>, and where I went wrong in steering the business. <strong>Continue</strong> reading <strong>Relato</strong>: Turking the business graph.</body>
