MyBinder -- Turn a <strong>GitHub</strong> <strong>repo</strong> into a <strong>collection</strong> of interactive notebooks. (via <strong>Julia Evans</strong>)

<strong>Molecule-Making <strong>AI</strong></strong> (<strong>Nature</strong>) -- The new <strong>AI</strong> <strong>tool</strong>, developed by <strong>Marwin Segler</strong>, an organic <strong>chemist</strong> and artificial <strong>intelligence researcher</strong> at the <strong>University</strong> of <strong>Münster</strong> in <strong>Germany</strong>, and his <strong>colleagues</strong>, uses deep learning neural <strong>networks</strong> to imbibe essentially all known single-step organic-<strong>chemist</strong>ry reactions—about 12.4 million of them. This enables it to predict the <strong>chemical</strong> <strong>reactions</strong> that can be used in any single step. The <strong>tool</strong> repeatedly applies these neural <strong>networks</strong> in planning a multi-step <strong>synthesis</strong>, deconstructing the desired <strong>molecule</strong> until it ends up with the available starting reagents. (via <strong>Slashdot</strong>)

<strong>Interpersonal Dynamics</strong> -- The <strong>list</strong> of common corrosive <strong>dynamics</strong> rang true: bone-deep <strong>competition</strong>; <strong>fear</strong> of being found out; my <strong><strong>reality</strong></strong> is not the <strong><strong>reality</strong></strong>; it's no <strong>fun</strong> being the <strong>squeaky wheel</strong>; <strong>feedback</strong> stays at the <strong>surface</strong>; denial that work is personal. <strong>Popmotion</strong> -- A functional, flexible <strong>JavaScript</strong> motion library. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 5 April 2018.</body>
