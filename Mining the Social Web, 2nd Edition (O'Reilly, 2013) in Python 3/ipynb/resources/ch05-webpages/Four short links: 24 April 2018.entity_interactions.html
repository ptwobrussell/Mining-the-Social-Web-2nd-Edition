    <body><strong><strong>IoT</strong></strong>, <strong>Migrations</strong>, <strong>Prisoner</strong>'s <strong>Dilemma</strong>, and Security

<strong><strong>IoT</strong></strong> Inspector -- The <strong>Princeton University</strong> <strong>research team</strong> is digging into the <strong>traffic</strong> that <strong><strong>IoT</strong></strong> <strong>devices</strong> do, to identify malicious or otherwise dodgy behaviour. They want to know what IoT devices you have so they can test them. They'll release their <strong>packet capture</strong> and <strong>analysis tool</strong> as open source. (via <strong>BoingBoing</strong>)

<strong>Migrations</strong> (<strong>Will Larson</strong>) -- very good <strong>explanation</strong> of how to manage <strong>migrations</strong> which are usually the only available <strong>avenue</strong> to make meaningful <strong>progress</strong> on technical debt. (via <strong>Simon Willison</strong>)

Beating the <strong>Prisoner</strong>'s <strong>Dilemma</strong> -- In 2013 as the <strong>semester</strong> ended in <strong>December</strong>, <strong>students</strong> in Fröhlich’s "<strong>Intermediate Programming</strong>," "<strong>Computer System Fundamentals</strong>," and "<strong>Introduction</strong> to Programming for <strong>Scientists</strong> and <strong>Engineers</strong>" <strong>classes</strong> decided to test the <strong>limits</strong> of the policy, and collectively planned to boycott the final. Because they all did, a <strong>zero</strong> was the highest <strong>score</strong> in each of the three <strong>classes</strong>, which, by the <strong>rules</strong> of Fröhlich’<strong>s curve</strong>, meant every <strong>student</strong> received an A. How did they manage to avoid defection? (If just one <strong>student</strong> sat the <strong>test</strong>, that <strong>person</strong> would get an <strong>A</strong> and <strong>everyone</strong> else <strong>fail</strong>) The <strong>student</strong>s waited outside the <strong>rooms</strong> to make sure that <strong>others</strong> honored the <strong>boycott</strong>, and were poised to go in if <strong>someone</strong> <strong>[</strong>broke the <strong>pact</strong>]. No one did, though. <strong>Prisoner</strong>'s <strong>Dilemma</strong> only works if the prisoners can't communicate. (via <strong>Freakonomics</strong> and <strong>Ian Miers</strong>)

<strong>Computer Security</strong>: The <strong>Achilles</strong>' <strong>Heel</strong> of the Air Force? -- incredibly <strong>prescient</strong> 1979 <strong>article</strong> on the important <strong>problems</strong> of security. The <strong>stories</strong> of repeatedly improving early <strong>systems</strong> like <strong>GCOS</strong> and <strong>MULTICS</strong> are super-interesting and rich with <strong>parallels</strong> for today. A contract cannot provide security. Basically, the same <strong>GCOS</strong> <strong>system</strong> was selected for a major <strong>command</strong> and control <strong>system</strong>. <strong>Advocates</strong> assured the <strong>users</strong> that it would be made multilevel <strong>secure</strong> because <strong>security</strong> was required by the contract. An extensive <strong>tiger team evaluation</strong> found there were many deep and complex <strong>security</strong> <strong>flaws</strong> that defied practical <strong>repair—the computer</strong> was finally deemed not only insecure but insecurable. <strong>Note</strong>: The email <strong>edition</strong> of <strong>Four Short Links</strong> will be discontinued on <strong>Monday</strong>, April 30. <strong>New</strong> <strong>editions</strong> of <strong><strong>Four Short Links</strong></strong> will still be published every <strong>weekday</strong> at <strong>oreilly.com/4sl</strong> and through the <strong><strong>Four Short Links</strong></strong> feed. <strong>Please</strong> send <strong>questions</strong> about this <strong>change</strong> to onlinecap<strong>@</strong>oreilly.com. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 24 April 2018.</body>
