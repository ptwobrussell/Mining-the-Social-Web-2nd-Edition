Deep Painterly Harmonisation -- composite and preserve the style of the destination image.</strong> The examples are impressive.

<strong>PowerHammer: Exfiltrate Data Over Power Lines -- In this case, a malicious code running on a compromised computer can control the power consumption of the system by intentionally regulating the CPU utilization.</strong> Data is modulated, encoded, and transmitted on top of the current flow fluctuations, and then it is conducted and propagated through the power lines.


<strong>Learn To Listen At The Cocktail Party -- We present a joint audio-visual model for isolating a single speech signal from a mixture of sounds such as other speakers and background noise.</strong> Solving this task using only audio as input is extremely challenging and does not provide an association of the separated speech signals with speakers in the video. <strong>In this paper, we present a deep network-based model that incorporates both visual and auditory signals to solve this task.</strong> <strong>The visual features are used to "focus" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality.</strong>
