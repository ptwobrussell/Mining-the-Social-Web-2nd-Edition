    <body><strong>Innovations</strong> that increase <strong>detection</strong> of, and <strong>response</strong> to, criminal <strong>attacks</strong> of financial <strong>systems.In</strong> this <strong>episode</strong> of the O’Reilly Podcast, I talk with <strong>Simon Moss</strong>, <strong>vice president</strong> of <strong>industry consulting</strong> and <strong>solutions</strong>, <strong>Americas</strong>, at Teradata. We discuss how <strong>machine <strong>learning</strong></strong> and deep <strong>learning</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> are being used to fight financial <strong>crimes</strong>, such as <strong>credit card fraud</strong>, <strong>identity theft</strong>, <strong>health care fraud</strong>, and money laundering. <strong>Discussion</strong> <strong>points</strong>:

<strong>Moss</strong> says <strong>AI</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> are “a new <strong>set</strong> of <strong>weapons</strong><strong>”</strong> against <strong>perpetrators</strong> of financial crime. “If we use them right, we can finally at least slow down the constant <strong>tide</strong> of financial crime.”
<strong>AI</strong> can be more effective than traditional <strong>methods</strong> of combatting <strong>identity fraud</strong>, <strong>health care fraud</strong>, and <strong>money laundering</strong>, because for those <strong>issues</strong>, he explains, “you’re not looking for a <strong>needle</strong> in a haystack. You’re looking for a <strong>needle</strong> in a <strong>stack</strong> of <strong>needle</strong>s. You are trying to find <strong>individuals</strong> whose nefarious <strong>activity</strong> is disguised and hidden in pure <strong>normality</strong>, by completely innocuous <strong>activity</strong>.”
<strong>Moss</strong> compares the <strong>use</strong> of <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>techniques</strong> to a <strong><strong>rules</strong></strong> <strong><strong>engine</strong></strong>: “a <strong><strong>rules</strong></strong> <strong><strong>engine</strong></strong> looks for <strong>behaviors</strong> that have already happened, whereas <strong>machine</strong> learning is trying to connect different bread crumbs. It<strong><strong><strong>’</strong></strong></strong>s running multiple <strong>scenarios</strong> at the same <strong>time</strong> to try to look at the <strong>problem</strong> from multiple different <strong>angles.</strong>”
Machine <strong>learning</strong> can add <strong>efficiency</strong> to the <strong>detection process</strong>: <strong>“</strong>It can take multiple <strong><strong>data</strong> sources</strong>, map the <strong>data</strong> to a <strong>case</strong>, analyze it, and then in <strong>seconds</strong>, make a <strong>decision</strong> on whether it<strong><strong><strong>’</strong></strong></strong>s a false positive, whether it<strong><strong><strong>’</strong></strong></strong>s normal <strong>business activity</strong>, whether it<strong><strong><strong>’</strong></strong></strong>s <strong>something</strong> that needs further <strong>investigation</strong>, or whether it is outright <strong>criminality</strong>,” Moss says.
