    <body><strong>DNA</strong> for <strong>Data</strong>, <strong>Project Names</strong>, <strong>VGA SDR</strong>, and Image Magic

Exabytes in a <strong>Test Tube</strong>: The <strong>Case</strong> for <strong>DNA</strong> <strong>Data</strong> Storage -- still in its <strong>infancy</strong>, but <strong>researchers</strong> are drawn by high <strong>storage density</strong> (up to 1E12 <strong>GB/gram</strong>), unpowered, and durable in "ideal" conditions. There are even people working on random-access tech. <strong>Waggle Dance</strong> -- <strong>Hive</strong> federation service. <strong>Enables</strong> disparate <strong>tables</strong> to be concurrently accessed across multiple <strong>Hive</strong> deployments. (<strong>Hive</strong> is an <strong>Apache</strong> data warehouse project.) This easily wins <strong>today</strong>'s <strong>award</strong> for Best Project Name. (<strong>Circus Train</strong> is a good <strong>name</strong>, but not as {fingerkiss} as Waggle Dance. VGA as SDR -- this is wild. osmo-fl2k <strong>allows</strong> you to use <strong>USB</strong> 3.0 to <strong>VGA</strong> <strong>adapters</strong> based on the <strong>Fresco Logic FL2000</strong> <strong>chip</strong>, which are available for around $5, as general <strong>purpose</strong> <strong>DACs</strong> and <strong>SDR</strong> <strong>transmitter</strong> generating a continuous <strong>stream</strong> of <strong>samples</strong> by avoiding the <strong>HSYNC</strong> and <strong>VSYNC</strong> <strong>blanking</strong> intervals. Can transmit low-power <strong>FM</strong>, <strong>DAB</strong>, <strong>DVB-T</strong>, <strong>GSM</strong>, <strong>UMTS</strong>, and <strong>GPS</strong> signals. <strong>Image</strong> Inpainting for <strong>Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions</strong> -- the <strong>video</strong> is solid gold wow.
