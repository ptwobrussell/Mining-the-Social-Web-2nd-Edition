    <body>Like good <strong>code</strong>, good <strong>documentation</strong> is difficult and <strong>time</strong> consuming to write.Imagine for a <strong>moment</strong> two common <strong>scenarios</strong> in the <strong>life</strong> of a web developer. In the first <strong>scenario</strong>, <strong>meet</strong> Harlow. <strong>To<strong>day</strong></strong> is <strong>Harlow</strong>'s first <strong>day</strong> on a new project. The <strong>team</strong> has a well-established <strong>codebase</strong>, a great working <strong>environment</strong>, and a robust test suite. As <strong>Harlow</strong> sits down at her <strong>desk</strong>, she's excited to get up to speed with the team. After the <strong>morning</strong> stand-up <strong>meeting</strong> she's pointed to the <strong>project</strong>'s <strong>documentation</strong> for <strong>installation</strong> with a slight <strong>grimace</strong> from her <strong>colleague</strong> Riley. He mentions that the docs "might be a little out of date, but should hopefully be enough to get you going." <strong>Harlow</strong> then spends the <strong>rest</strong> of the <strong>day</strong> following the <strong>documentation</strong> until she gets stuck, at which <strong>point</strong> she is forced to dig through <strong>code</strong> or ask <strong>colleagues</strong> for guidance. What might have taken a few <strong>minutes</strong> becomes a day-long <strong>exercise</strong> in <strong>frustration</strong>, tampering <strong>Harlow</strong>'s initial excitement. In the second <strong>scenario</strong>, <strong>meet</strong> Harrison. He's working on a <strong>web app</strong> and finds a <strong>library</strong> that, at first <strong>glance</strong>, seems incredibly useful for his project. As he attempts to integrate it with his <strong>codebase</strong> he discovers that <strong>parts</strong> of the <strong>API</strong> seem to be glossed over in the documentation or even undocumented. In the <strong>end</strong>, he walks away from the <strong>project</strong> in <strong>favor</strong> of another solution. Though these scenarios may be slightly exaggerated, I'm reasonably certain that many of us can relate. These <strong>problems</strong> were not primarily caused by <strong>low-quality code</strong>, but rather by poor documentation. If useful <strong>documentation</strong> is so important to the <strong>success</strong> of <strong>projects</strong> and developer <strong>well-being</strong>, why don't all <strong>projects</strong> have it? The <strong>answer</strong>, I believe, is that like good <strong>code</strong>, good <strong>documentation</strong> is difficult and time consuming to write. In my <strong>eyes</strong>, there are eight <strong><strong>rule</strong>s</strong> that we can follow to produce good <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>:

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that is inviting and clear
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that is comprehensive, detailing all <strong>aspects</strong> of the <strong>project</strong>
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that is skimmable
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that offers <strong>examples</strong> of how to use the <strong>software</strong>
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that has <strong>repetition</strong>, when useful
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that is up-to-date
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that is easy to contribute to
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Write</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> that is easy to find

The most important <strong>rule</strong> of good <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>documentation</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> is for it to be as inviting as possible. This means that we should aim to write it in the <strong>clearest</strong> <strong>terms</strong> possible without skipping over any steps. We should avoid making assumptions about what our users may know. Sometimes this can seem to be overkill, and we may be tempted to say <strong>something</strong> like "every <strong>X</strong> <strong>developer</strong> knows about <strong>Y</strong>," but we each bring our own <strong>background</strong> and <strong>set</strong> of <strong>experiences</strong> to a project. Though this may result in more verbose <strong>documentation</strong>, it is ultimately simpler, as there is less <strong>guesswork</strong> involved for <strong>developers</strong> with all <strong>levels</strong> of experience. Documentation should aim to be comprehensive. This means that all aspects of the project are documented. Undocumented <strong>features</strong> or <strong>exceptions</strong> can lead to <strong>frustration</strong> and become a <strong>time suck</strong> as <strong>users</strong> and other <strong>developers</strong> are forced to read through <strong>code</strong> to find the answers they need. Fully documenting all <strong>features</strong> takes away this <strong>kind</strong> of ambiguity. When we write <strong>documentation</strong> that is skimmable, we help <strong>users</strong> find the content they need quickly. Making <strong>documentation</strong> skimmable can be accomplished by using clear <strong>headings</strong>, bulleted <strong>lists</strong>, and links. For large <strong>project documentation</strong>, a <strong>table</strong> of <strong>contents</strong> or clear <strong>navigation</strong> will help <strong>users</strong> to skip straight to what they need, rather than scrolling through a single long document. <strong>Documentation</strong> that features examples allows <strong>users</strong> to see how they might use the code themselves. <strong>Aim</strong> to provide <strong>examples</strong> of the most common <strong>use</strong> <strong>cases</strong> for the <strong>project</strong>, while letting the comprehensive <strong>documentation detail</strong> every possibility. It is perfectly acceptable to include some <strong><strong>repetition</strong></strong> in  <strong>documentation</strong>, which the <strong>Write</strong> the <strong>Docs</strong> <strong>project</strong> <strong>terms</strong> "<strong>ARID</strong>" (accepts (some) <strong><strong>repetition</strong></strong> in <strong>documentation</strong>). Doing so acknowledges that <strong>users</strong> may not read the full <strong>docs</strong> or that some <strong>information</strong> is relevant in multiple <strong>places</strong> in the documentation. While good <strong>code</strong> may be <strong>DRY</strong>, good <strong>writing</strong> aims to be clear, and sometimes this means repeating ourselves. The <strong>Write</strong> the <strong>Docs</strong> <strong>project</strong> calls out the <strong>difference</strong> between writing that is <strong>ARID</strong>, <strong>DRY</strong>, and <strong>WET</strong> in this <strong>way</strong>:
The <strong>pursuit</strong> of minimizing repetition remains valiant! <strong>ARID</strong> does not mean <strong>WET</strong>, hence the word choice. It means: <strong>try</strong> to keep <strong>things</strong> as <strong>DRY</strong> as possible, but also recognize that you’ll inevitably need some <strong>amount</strong> of “moisture” to produce documentation. Effective documentation is kept up-to-date. This is surprisingly challenging. We may begin our <strong>project</strong> with the best of <strong>intentions</strong> and great <strong>documentation</strong>, but as our <strong>software</strong> <strong>evolves</strong> and we are quickly iterating, it can be easy to fall out of step. If you are working as <strong>part</strong> of an <strong>agile development <strong>team</strong></strong>, I recommend adding <strong>documentation</strong> to your <strong>team</strong>'s "definition of done." For independent <strong>projects</strong>, try to treat <strong>documentation</strong> as an important final step. Documentation that is easy to contribute to is also easy to keep up-to-date. The simplest <strong>way</strong> to make <strong>documentation</strong> easy to contribute to is to treat it as <strong>code</strong>, storing it as <strong>text</strong> in source control. The <strong>site</strong> and <strong>book</strong> <strong>Docs</strong> Like <strong>Code</strong> <strong>advocates</strong> for treating our <strong>docs</strong> like our <strong>code</strong> by using <strong>source control</strong>, automating <strong>builds</strong>, and applying <strong>software development</strong> <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong> to our <strong>documentation</strong> practices. Documentation is only as helpful as it is easy to find. Keeping an updated <strong><strong>README</strong></strong> <strong>file</strong> and linking to more extensive <strong>documentation</strong> at the <strong>top</strong> of the <strong><strong>README</strong></strong> when necessary <strong>helps</strong> to keep discoverability simple. I hope these <strong>guidelines</strong> are useful as you draft your <strong>project</strong>'s documentation. Sometimes it is helpful to remember that <strong>documentation</strong> isn't just for other <strong>developers</strong>, but often for our future selves as well. When we return to a <strong>project</strong> after a <strong>number</strong> of <strong>months</strong>, we will appreciate the <strong>work</strong> we put into clear and up-to-date documentation. <strong>Continue</strong> reading The eight <strong>rules</strong> of good documentation.</body>
