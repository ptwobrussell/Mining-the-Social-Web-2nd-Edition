Hide Data in Dubstep Drops -- the blog post shows how to use it.</strong> Skrillex meets steganography!

<strong>Parsing Timeline -- wonderfully detailed, yet it reads almost chatty.</strong> Interesting and informative.

Securing Wireless Neurostimulators -- a hack and discussion of the risk of insecure implantable medical devices that interface with the brain. <strong>(via Paper a Day)

Text Embedding Models Contain Bias (Google) -- great to see this making its way to research outputs, instead of being the province of damage control and bad PR.</strong> <strong>The Developers section of the Semantic Experiences microsite talks about "unwanted associations": In Semantris, the list of words we're showing are hand curated and reviewed.</strong> <strong>To the extent possible, we've excluded topics and entities that we think particularly invite unwanted associations, or can easily complement them as inputs.</strong> In Talk to Books, while we can't manually vet each sentence of 100,000 volumes, we use a popularity measure which increases the proportion of volumes that are published by professional publishing houses. There are additional measures that could be taken. For example, a toxicity classifier or sensitive topics classifier could determine when the input or the output is something that may be objectionable or party to an unwanted association. We recommend taking bias-impact mitigation steps when crafting end-user applications built with these models.
