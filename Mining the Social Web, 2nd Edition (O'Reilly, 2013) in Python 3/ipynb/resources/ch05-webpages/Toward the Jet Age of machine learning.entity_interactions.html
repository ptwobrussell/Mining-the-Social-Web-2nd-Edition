    <body>Solving the <strong>challenges</strong> of <strong>efficiency</strong>, <strong>automation</strong>, and <strong>safety</strong> will require <strong>cooperation</strong> between <strong>researchers</strong> and <strong>engineers</strong> spanning both <strong>academia</strong> and <strong>industry.Machine learning today</strong> resembles the <strong>dawn</strong> of aviation. In 1903, dramatic <strong><strong>flight</strong>s</strong> by the <strong>Wright</strong> <strong>brothers</strong> ushered in the <strong>Pioneer Age</strong> of <strong>aviation</strong>, and within a <strong>decade</strong>, there was widespread <strong>belief</strong> that powered <strong>flight</strong> would revolutionize <strong>transportation</strong> and society more generally. <strong>Machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) today is also rapidly advancing. We have recently witnessed remarkable <strong>breakthroughs</strong> on important <strong>problems</strong> including <strong>image recognition</strong>, <strong>speech translation</strong>, and natural <strong>language processing</strong>, and major <strong>technology</strong> <strong>companies</strong> are investing <strong>billions</strong> of <strong>dollars</strong> to transform themselves into ML-centric organizations. There is a growing <strong>conviction</strong> that <strong>ML</strong> holds the <strong>key</strong> to some of <strong>society</strong><strong>’</strong>s most pressing problems. Figure 1. The <strong>Wright</strong> <strong>brothers</strong>’ first powered <strong>airplane</strong> traveled 120 <strong>feet</strong> during its initial 12 second <strong>flight</strong> on <strong>December</strong> 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk.

For all the <strong>enthusiasm</strong> that the <strong>Wright</strong> <strong>brothers</strong> generated, nearly half a <strong>century</strong> would pass before widespread commercial <strong>aviation</strong> finally became a reality. During the <strong>Pioneer Age</strong>, <strong>aviation</strong> was largely restricted to private, <strong>sport</strong>, and military use. Getting to the <strong>Jet Age</strong> required a <strong>series</strong> of fundamental <strong>innovations</strong> in aeronautical <strong>engineering—monoplane</strong> <strong>wings</strong>, <strong>aluminum</strong> <strong>designs</strong>, <strong>turbine</strong> <strong>engines</strong>, <strong>stress testing</strong>, jumbo jets, etc. Figure 2. <strong>Decades</strong> of <strong>advances</strong> in aeronautical <strong>engineering</strong> led to the <strong>Jet Age</strong> in the 1950s, which fundamentally changed societal <strong>behavior</strong> and enabled us to tackle new <strong>challenges—e.g.</strong>, space exploration.

Similarly, we need to invent a new <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>engineering</strong> to build <strong>ML</strong> applications. Data-driven <strong><strong>software development</strong></strong> is radically different from conventional <strong><strong>software development</strong></strong>, as it targets complex <strong>applications domains</strong> (<strong><strong>e.g.</strong></strong>, <strong>vision</strong>, <strong>speech</strong>, <strong>language</strong>) and focuses on learned <strong>behaviors</strong> instead of rule-based <strong>operations</strong> (<strong><strong>e.g.</strong></strong>, training deep neural <strong>networks</strong> on massive <strong>data sets</strong> versus hand-coded if-then-else statements). Currently, very few <strong>organizations</strong> have the <strong>expertise</strong> to do this <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>engineering</strong>, and we are just scratching the <strong>surface</strong> of the potential for <strong>ML-powered</strong> technology. We describe three key challenges of this new development paradigm below. Figure 3. The <strong>turbine engine</strong>, developed over several <strong>decades</strong>, resulted in <strong>planes</strong> that were dramatically faster and more efficient, enabling <strong>travel</strong> around the <strong>world</strong> in less than a day.

<strong>Modern ML</strong> <strong>applications</strong> typically involve complex <strong>models</strong> and massive <strong>data sets</strong>, requiring significant computational and storage resources. For <strong>instance</strong>, <strong>engineers</strong> at <strong>Google Brain</strong> needed more than 250,000 <strong>GPU</strong> <strong>hours</strong> to train a neural <strong>translation model</strong> for a single <strong>pair</strong> of <strong>languages</strong> (<strong>English</strong> and <strong>German</strong>), which costs about $200,000 on Google Compute Engine. [1<strong>]</strong> In <strong>response</strong>, a wide <strong>range</strong> of specialized <strong>hardware</strong> <strong>solutions</strong> are being developed (e.g., <strong>GPUs</strong>, <strong>TPUs</strong>, massively parallel <strong>CPUs</strong>, <strong>FPGAs</strong>) to improve the <strong>speed</strong>, <strong>energy efficiency</strong>, and <strong>cost</strong> of <strong>ML-powered</strong> applications. However, effectively leveraging heterogenous <strong>hardware</strong> will require us to fundamentally redesign <strong>ML</strong> software itself. In part<strong>i</strong>cular, systems-aware <strong>algor<strong>i</strong>thms</strong> and <strong>software</strong> are needed (<strong>i</strong>) to eff<strong>i</strong>c<strong>i</strong>ently tra<strong>i</strong>n <strong>models</strong> on mass<strong>i</strong>vely parallel and heterogeneous <strong>hardware</strong>, and (<strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong>) to sat<strong>i</strong>sfy serv<strong>i</strong>ce level <strong>agreements</strong> (<strong>SLAs</strong>) related to <strong>latency</strong>, power consumpt<strong>i</strong>on, and memory footpr<strong>i</strong>nt constra<strong>i</strong>nts for product<strong>i</strong>on deployments. <strong>Advances</strong> in <strong>hardware</strong> must be closely coupled with algorithmic and <strong>software innovation</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to develop and deploy ML-based <strong>applications</strong> in a timely and economical fashion. Figure 4. <strong>Automation</strong> is widespread in modern commercial <strong>aviation</strong>, including <strong>plane manufacturing / testing</strong>, <strong>air traffic control</strong>, and even operating planes.

In <strong>addition</strong> to being computationally intensive, <strong>ML</strong>-powered <strong>applications</strong> are incredibly labor-intensive for <strong>ML</strong> <strong>engineers</strong> to train, <strong>debug</strong>, and deploy. <strong>First</strong>, even selecting the appropriate computational <strong>platform</strong> is challenging, given the rapidly changing <strong>hardware landscape</strong> and diverse <strong>set</strong> of available cloud-based offerings. Second, the <strong>quality</strong> of an <strong>ML</strong> <strong>model</strong> is highly sensitive to <strong><strong>hyperparameters</strong></strong>; tuning these <strong><strong>hyperparameters</strong></strong> is crucial for <strong>accuracy</strong> but is often labor-intensive and expensive in computational cost. <strong>Third</strong>, utilizing parallel <strong>hardware</strong> at training time is highly non-trivial. Naively boosting computational <strong>power</strong> often does not result in meaningful <strong>speedups</strong>, and fair and effective <strong>sharing</strong> of cluster <strong>resources</strong> among users can be challenging. To make <strong>things</strong> worse, developing <strong>ML</strong> <strong>applications</strong> is not a one-shot <strong>process</strong>: <strong>data changes</strong> over <strong>time</strong>, and therefore <strong>models</strong> and systems must adapt. Diagnosing and updating stale <strong>models</strong> is challenging, and exacerbated by the surprising <strong>difficulty</strong> (and sometimes impossibility[2<strong>]</strong>) of reproducing the <strong>behavior</strong> of <strong>ML</strong> applications. These <strong><strong>i</strong>ssues</strong> are due to many <strong>factors</strong>, <strong>i</strong>nclud<strong>i</strong>ng (<strong>i</strong>) the stat<strong>i</strong>st<strong>i</strong>cal or "fuzzy" <strong>nature</strong> of these appl<strong>i</strong>cat<strong>i</strong>ons; (<strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong>) the complex<strong>i</strong>ty of <strong>ML</strong> appl<strong>i</strong>cat<strong>i</strong>ons (<strong>e.g.</strong>, p<strong>i</strong>pel<strong>i</strong>ne <strong>jungles</strong>[3<strong>]</strong>); and (<strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong>) <strong>ad-hoc development</strong> <strong>processes</strong> <strong>i</strong>n wh<strong>i</strong>ch both <strong>code</strong> and <strong>data</strong> evolve over t<strong>i</strong>me w<strong>i</strong>th <strong>i</strong>nadequate (and somet<strong>i</strong>mes non-ex<strong>i</strong>stent) controls. Given the <strong>shortage</strong> and <strong>cost</strong> of <strong><strong>ML</strong></strong> <strong>talent</strong> and the increased <strong>demands</strong> for <strong><strong>ML</strong></strong> <strong>technology</strong>, there is a pressing <strong>need</strong> to automate and simplify these <strong>development</strong> and <strong>deployment</strong> processes. Figure 5. The widespread <strong>adoption</strong> of commercial <strong>aviation</strong> hinged on dramatic <strong><strong>advances</strong></strong> in <strong>aviation</strong> safety, including <strong><strong>advances</strong></strong> in <strong>plane design</strong> and <strong>testing</strong>, as well as the <strong>creation</strong> of international and domestic regulatory <strong>bodies—e.g.</strong>, the <strong>ICAO</strong> and FAA.

As <strong>ML</strong> applications become more ubiquitous and increasingly influence societal <strong>interactions</strong> (<strong>e.g.</strong>, curating <strong>news</strong>, determining <strong>credit worthiness</strong>, influencing criminal <strong>sentencing</strong>, navigating <strong>vehicles</strong> autonomously), the <strong>safety</strong> <strong>risks</strong> associated with the <strong>misuse</strong> or <strong>misunderstanding</strong> of this technology are magnified. It is, thus, critical to understand and audit the <strong>behavior</strong> of <strong>ML</strong> <strong>applications</strong>: do we understand how <strong>models</strong> are making their decisions? What is the <strong>confidence<<strong>/</strong>strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong>uncertainty</strong> associated with individual decisions? Do these <strong>predictions</strong> pose immediate <strong>threats</strong> to an individual or to society? What are the broader ethical <strong>ramifications</strong> of a given <strong>ML</strong> application? What information is being used to make decisions? Is individual privacy adequately being preserved? Unfortunately, <strong>ML</strong> <strong>applications</strong> do not provide us with <strong>straightforward</strong> <strong>answers</strong> to these questions. They are inherently data-driven and not based on simple <strong>rules</strong>, and we have a fundamental <strong>lack</strong> of understanding as to why leading <strong>ML</strong> <strong>approaches</strong> (<strong>e.g.</strong>, deep <strong>learning</strong> <strong>models</strong>) even <strong>work</strong> in the first place. In <strong>addition</strong> to advancing our basic scientific <strong>understanding</strong>, it is paramount that we develop robust <strong>ML-centric</strong> <strong>engineering</strong> processes to mitigate potential <strong>safety</strong> risks. These new <strong>processes</strong> must address the <strong>complexity</strong> and <strong>uncertainty inherent</strong> to <strong>ML</strong> applications. The interdisciplinary <strong>path</strong> forward
These <strong>challenges—efficiency</strong>, <strong>automation</strong>, and safety—won<strong>’</strong>t be solved overnight. It is clear that they touch a broad <strong>set</strong> of <strong>disciplines</strong>, and consequently devising effective <strong>solutions</strong> will require <strong>cooperation</strong> between <strong>researchers</strong> and <strong>engineers</strong> spanning both <strong>academia</strong> and industry. From an academic <strong>perspective</strong>, we are already witnessing encouraging <strong>signs</strong> of interdisciplinary <strong>progress</strong>, as these <strong>core</strong> <strong>challenges</strong> have spurred the <strong>development</strong> of new <strong>research</strong> communities. Two notable <strong>examples</strong> are: (<strong>i</strong>) the Sys<strong>ML</strong>[4<strong><strong>]</strong></strong> research commun<strong>i</strong>ty that works at the <strong>i</strong>ntersect<strong>i</strong>on of <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> and <strong>ML</strong> to des<strong>i</strong>gn system-aware algor<strong>i</strong>thms and <strong>i</strong>dent<strong>i</strong>fy best pract<strong>i</strong>ces for learn<strong>i</strong>ng <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong>; and (<strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong>) the Fat<strong>ML</strong>[5<strong><strong>]</strong></strong> research commun<strong>i</strong>ty that br<strong>i</strong>ngs together a d<strong>i</strong>verse set of soc<strong>i</strong>al and quant<strong>i</strong>tat<strong>i</strong>ve <strong>researchers</strong> and pract<strong>i</strong>t<strong>i</strong>oners concerned w<strong>i</strong>th fa<strong>i</strong>rness, accountab<strong>i</strong>l<strong>i</strong>ty, and <strong>transparency</strong> <strong>i</strong>n <strong>ML</strong>. However, we ultimately want to move beyond academic <strong>research</strong>, and leverage cutting-edge theoretical <strong>advances</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to design and build increasingly robust and sophisticated <strong>engineering</strong> systems. To do so will require <strong>coordination</strong> between <strong>researchers</strong> working on more <strong>abstract</strong> and theoretical <strong>problems</strong> and <strong>engineers</strong> who understand industrial <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>real-world deployment</strong> requirements. While we have a long <strong>way</strong> to go before we arrive at the <strong>Jet Age</strong> of <strong><strong>ML</strong></strong>, continued collaborative <strong>efforts</strong> will truly enable <strong><strong>ML</strong></strong> to take flight.
