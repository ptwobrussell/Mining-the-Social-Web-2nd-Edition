Roman Roads and Persistence Development -- In some ways, the emergence of the Roman road network is almost a natural experimentâ€”in light of the military purpose of the roads, the preferred straightness of their construction, and their construction in newly conquered and often undeveloped regions.

At the same time, the abandonment of the wheel shock in MENA appears to have been powerful enough to cause that degree of persistence to break down. Overall, our analysis suggests that a public good provision is a powerful channel through which persistence in comparative development comes about. <strong>I wonder whether this kind of analysis is even conceivable with internet public policy like broadband, coding classes, and laws.</strong> (via BoingBoing)
