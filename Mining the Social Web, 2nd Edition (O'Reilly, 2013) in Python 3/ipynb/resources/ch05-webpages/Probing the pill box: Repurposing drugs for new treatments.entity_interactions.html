    <body>As the <strong>cost</strong> of developing new <strong>drugs rises</strong>, <strong>researchers</strong> are investigating new <strong>ways</strong> to use existing <strong><strong>medicines</strong></strong>
With the <strong>development</strong> of new <strong><strong>medicines</strong></strong> often exceeding 10 <strong>years</strong> and topping $1 billion, faster and cheaper <strong>methods</strong> of drug <strong>development</strong> are sorely needed. <strong>Drug repurposing</strong>, whereby <strong>drugs</strong> approved for one <strong>condition</strong> are used to treat a completely different <strong>disease</strong>, is a fast-emerging <strong>strategy</strong> aimed at circumventing this daunting pipeline. Several <strong>biotechnology</strong> <strong>companies</strong> now specialize in identifying new drug-disease <strong>pairs</strong> by interrogating massive biomedical <strong>datasets</strong> with ever-evolving artificial intelligence algorithms. This systematic <strong>approach</strong> to repurposing, augmenting the <strong>chance application</strong> of <strong>drugs</strong> to new <strong>diseases</strong>, represents a powerful <strong>tool</strong> for producing new medicines. Indeed, major <strong>drug</strong> <strong>companies</strong> such as <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> have committed to probing “<strong>dark</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>,<strong>”</strong> or failed <strong>trial</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, to achieve this goal. The <strong>Promise</strong> of <strong>Drug</strong> Repositioning
The <strong>time</strong> and <strong>money</strong> required to bring a new <strong>drug</strong> to <strong>market</strong> severely limits the <strong><strong>number</strong></strong> of new <strong>treatments</strong>, in <strong>part</strong> explaining the steady <strong>decline</strong> in the <strong><strong>number</strong></strong> of approved <strong>drug</strong>s entering <strong>use</strong> each year. The <strong>drug development process</strong>, <strong>overseen</strong> in the <strong>United</strong> <strong>States</strong> by the <strong>Food</strong> and <strong>Drug Administration</strong> (<strong>FDA</strong>), has three main stages. <strong>Candidate</strong> <strong>compounds</strong>, which are being generated in <strong>abundance</strong> by <strong>discovery science</strong> and have established <strong>mechanisms</strong> of <strong>action</strong>, safe <strong>dosages</strong>, and a pharmacokinetic <strong>profile</strong>, begin in <strong>Phase</strong> I trials. In this <strong>trial stage</strong>, the <strong>safety profile</strong> of the <strong>compound</strong> is established, usually in healthy volunteers. Promising <strong>candidates</strong> are selected for <strong>Phase II</strong> <strong>trials</strong>, which determine the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of the <strong>compound</strong> at treating a particular <strong>disease</strong> or <strong>indication</strong> in a small sample group. Positive <strong>candidates</strong> are admitted to a <strong>Phase III</strong> <strong>trial</strong>, which takes <strong>place</strong> in a larger patient <strong>population</strong>, where the <strong>efficacy</strong> of the <strong>drug</strong> and its <strong>side-effects</strong> are fully assessed.Continue reading Probing the <strong>pill box</strong>: <strong>Repurposing</strong> <strong>drug</strong>s for new treatments.</body>
