    <body>Free <strong><strong>Multics</strong></strong>, <strong>Community Relevance</strong>, <strong>Speech Synthesis</strong>, and Dandelion Data

BAN.AI <strong><strong>Multics</strong></strong> -- free <strong>multiuser</strong> <strong><strong>Multics</strong></strong> (<strong>predecessor</strong> to <strong>Unix</strong>) emulation. This Multics guide will be useful. The <strong>Art</strong> of <strong>Relevance</strong> -- explores how mission-driven <strong>organizations</strong> can matter more to more people. The <strong>book</strong> is packed with inspiring <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>rags-to-relevance case</strong> <strong>studies</strong>, research-based <strong>frame<strong>work</strong>s</strong>, and practical <strong>advice</strong> on how your <strong>work</strong> can be more vital to your community. Should be read by startups (relevant to your customers?) and <strong>anyone</strong> who is trying to build a <strong>community</strong> around their software. <strong>Text</strong> available for free <strong>online</strong>, <strong>print</strong> <strong>versions</strong> still available for purchase. <strong><strong>Voice</strong>Loop</strong>: <strong>Voice</strong> <strong>Fitting</strong> and <strong>Synthesis</strong> via a <strong>Phonological Loop</strong> -- We present a new neural <strong><strong>text</strong></strong> to speech (<strong>TTS</strong>) <strong>method</strong> that is able to transform <strong><strong>text</strong></strong> to speech in <strong>voices</strong> that are sampled in the wild. Unlike other <strong>systems</strong>, our <strong>solution</strong> is able to deal with unconstrained <strong>voice</strong> <strong>samples</strong> and without requiring aligned <strong>phonemes</strong> or linguistic features. The Presidential voices are impressive. Code and paper available. No <strong>Boundaries</strong> for <strong>Facebook Data</strong> -- <strong>Today</strong> we report yet another <strong>type</strong> of surreptitious <strong>data</strong> <strong>collection</strong> by third-party <strong>scripts</strong> that we discovered: the <strong>exfiltration</strong> of personal <strong>identifiers</strong> from <strong>websites</strong> through <strong>“</strong><strong><strong>login</strong></strong> with Facebook” and other such social <strong><strong>login</strong></strong> APIs. Specifically, we found two <strong>types</strong> of <strong>vulnerabilities</strong>: seven third <strong>parties</strong> abuse <strong>websites</strong>’ <strong>access</strong> to <strong>Facebook user</strong> <strong>data</strong>; one third <strong>party</strong> uses its own <strong>Facebook “</strong>application” to track <strong>users</strong> around the web. Check out the "<strong>Emerging</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>case</strong> <strong>studies</strong>" <strong>sessions</strong> at the <strong>Strata Data Conference</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, May 21-24, 2018. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 19 April 2018.</body>
