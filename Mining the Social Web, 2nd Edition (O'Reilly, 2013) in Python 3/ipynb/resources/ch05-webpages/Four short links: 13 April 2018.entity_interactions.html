Deep Painterly Harmonisation -- composite and preserve the <strong>style</strong> of the destination image. The examples are impressive. <strong>PowerHammer</strong>: <strong>Exfiltrate Data Over Power Lines</strong> -- In this <strong>case</strong>, a malicious <strong>code</strong> running on a compromised <strong>computer</strong> can control the <strong>power consumption</strong> of the <strong>system</strong> by intentionally regulating the <strong>CPU</strong> utilization. <strong>Data</strong> is modulated, encoded, and transmitted on <strong>top</strong> of the current flow <strong>fluctuations</strong>, and then it is conducted and propagated through the <strong>power</strong> lines. <strong>Learn</strong> To Listen At The <strong>Cocktail Party</strong> -- We present a joint audio-visual <strong>model</strong> for isolating a single <strong>speech signal</strong> from a <strong>mixture</strong> of <strong>sounds</strong> such as other <strong>speakers</strong> and background noise. Solving this <strong>task</strong> using only audio as <strong>input</strong> is extremely challenging and does not provide an <strong>association</strong> of the separated <strong>speech</strong> <strong>signals</strong> with <strong>speakers</strong> in the video. In this <strong>paper</strong>, we present a deep network-based <strong>model</strong> that incorporates both visual and auditory <strong>signals</strong> to solve this task. The visual <strong>features</strong> are used to "focus" the <strong>audio</strong> on desired <strong>speakers</strong> in a <strong>scene</strong> and to improve the speech separation quality. <strong>prototool</strong> -- a Swiss <strong>Army Knife</strong> for <strong>protocol</strong> buffers. Check out the "<strong>Data Science</strong> & <strong>Machine Learning</strong>" <strong>sessions</strong>Â at the <strong>Strata Data Conference</strong> in <strong>London</strong>, May 21-24, 2018. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 13 April 2018.</body>
