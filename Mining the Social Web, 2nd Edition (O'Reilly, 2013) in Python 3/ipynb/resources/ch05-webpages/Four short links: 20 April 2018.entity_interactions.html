    <body><strong>Functional Programming</strong>, <strong>High-Dimensional Data</strong>, <strong>Games</strong> and <strong>Datavis</strong>, and Container Management

Interview with <strong>Simon Peyton-Jones</strong> -- I had always assumed that the more bleeding-edge <strong>changes</strong> to the <strong>type system</strong>, <strong>things</strong> like type-level <strong>functions</strong>, generalized <strong>algebraic</strong> <strong><strong>data types</strong></strong> (<strong>GADTs</strong>), higher <strong>rank polymorphism</strong>, and existential <strong><strong>data types</strong></strong>, would be picked up and used enthusiastically by <strong>Ph.D.</strong> <strong>students</strong> in <strong>search</strong> of a <strong>topic</strong>, but not really used much in industry. But in <strong>fact</strong>, it turns out that <strong>people</strong> in <strong>companies</strong> are using some of these still-not-terribly-stable extensions. I think it's because <strong>people</strong> in <strong>companies</strong> are writing <strong>software</strong> that they want to still be able to maintain and modify in five <strong>years</strong> time. <strong>SPJ</strong> is the <strong>creator</strong> of <strong>Haskell</strong>, and one of the leading <strong>thinkers</strong> in functional programming. <strong>HyperTools</strong> -- A <strong>Python</strong> <strong>toolbox</strong> for visualizing and manipulating high-dimensional data. Open source. High-dimensional <strong>=</strong> "a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>columns</strong> in each row". What Videogames Have to Teach Us About <strong>Data Visualization</strong> -- super-interesting <strong>exploration</strong> of <strong>space</strong>, storytelling, <strong>structure</strong>, and annotations. <strong>Titus</strong> -- <strong>Netflix</strong> open-sourced their container management platform. There aren't many <strong>companies</strong> with the <strong>scale</strong> <strong>problems</strong> of <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, etc., so it's always interesting to see what comes out of them. Check out the Evolutionary <strong>Architecture</strong> <strong>sessions</strong> at <strong>OSCON</strong>, <strong>July</strong> 16-19, 2018, in Portland. <strong>Hurryâ€”best</strong> <strong>price</strong> <strong>ends</strong> April 20. <strong>Continue</strong> reading Four short <strong>links</strong>: 20 April 2018.</body>
